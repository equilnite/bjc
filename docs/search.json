It’s not just for students; professional programmers work with partners too.\n\nIf each of you is in front of a computer, one of you should keep Snap! open, and the other should keep this lab page open. If you are sharing a computer, use two browser tabs.\n\n\n\nMaking a Character Move\n\n\n\n\nMake sure either you or your partner is logged in to Snap! so you can save your work.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving a Snap! Project\n\n\nChoose “Save” from the Snap! File menu, .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This is Alonzo, the mascot of our programming language, Snap!. You should see him on the stage, the white area in the top right corner of the Snap! window.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re going to program a game in which the goal is to click on Alonzo as he’s moving around.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a first step, make Alonzo jump someplace else on the stage when he’s clicked. Drag these two blocks into the scripting area (the center area of the window):\n\n\n\nYou can find blocks in palettes with their matching color. Drag one block underneath another to snap them together.\n\n\n \n\nCRD-2.B.1\n\n\nThis is a computer program, also known as software. It’s a very short one, but it’ll get more interesting soon.\n\n\n\nTest your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the stage several times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.\n\n\nIf your program doesn’t work, look back at the picture of the code and make sure yours matches exactly.\n\n\nMake sure the two blocks are attached to each other by moving the when I am clicked block and checking that the go to block moves with it.\n\n\nMake sure that the first block says when I am (clicked) and not something else, and make sure that the second block says go to (random position) and not something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrange boxes contain the ideas you should still remember three years from now.\n\n  \n\nCRD-2.C.2, CRD-2.C.3, CRD-2.C.5\n\n\nBlocks that look like this can be used to detect an event such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap! programmers call them “hat blocks.” Using events to control a program is called event-driven programming.\n\n\nNot every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind when I am (clicked) and when (space) key pressed in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a good idea to save your project every so often.\n\n\n\n\nChoose “Save” from the Snap! File menu, .\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game Challenging\n\n\n\nThe game isn’t much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked. Once you’ve clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says “do this forever.” And there is a block that does it: \n\n\n\n\n\nA bunch of blocks clicked together is called a script.\n\nAttach this to the bottom of your Alonzo script: \n\nThe sequence of blocks inside the forever block will repeat until you click the red stop sign, , or stop the script in some other way.\n\n\nClick for an animation of snapping these two blocks together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonzo moves too fast. Use the  block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.\n\nWhere the wait block goes in your script matters. Do you want the script to wait one time or each time Alonzo moves?"

    "text": "Now the game is challenging, but players can’t tell how well they’re doing because Alonzo jumps around whether the player clicks him or not. On this page, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.\n\n\nConfirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked\n\n\nFirst, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.\n\n\n: Sprites and Costumes\n\nThe Alonzo character is named after Alonzo Church, a major contributor to early computer science. In this project, there are three objects related to Alonzo:\n\n\nOne is a sprite, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.\n\n\nThe other two are costumes, picture that can be “worn” by a sprite.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.   \n\n\nThe project you loaded has two Alonzo costumes—one facing right and the other facing left—so you can use the  block to make the sprite face the other way. Add the next costume block to the place in your program where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.\n\n\nTest your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is clicked but not when he jumps without being clicked.\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Score\n\n\n\nThe player will also want to know how much progress they have made in the game. The command  can control Alonzo’s transparency.\n\n\n\nThe transparency of an image is how much you can see what’s behind it. For example, here is the Alonzo sprite shown with three different transparencies (which have been set using the ghost effect block). \n\n\n\n\nUse transparency to tell the user how close they are to winning: every time they click, Alonzo gets more invisible, and when he disappears completely, they win the game.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the change (ghost) effect block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does. At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible? You can use the command  to make Alonzo fully opaque again.\n\n\nThen, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly. Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game. Try out your game.\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game More Challenging\n\n\nSo far, even a bad player will eventually make Alonzo disappear. The game will be much more interesting if the player is penalized for missing a click.\n\n\n\n\nFigure out where to add a change (ghost) effect by (-5) block to your script to make Alonzo get less transparent any time he moves without being clicked.\n\n\nPlay your game a few times, and adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.\n\n\nYou can change the change effect input number (for either instance of the block) and/or the wait time to make the game easier or harder.\n\n\n\n\nEnding the Game\n\n\n\nWhen Alonzo is completely transparent, the game should stop.\n\n\n\nAdd this code to the right place in your script to end the game."

    "title": "Pair Programming",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On this page, you will learn about collaborating by using pair programming.\n\n\n\nIn the early days of computers, programming was something you did alone. You planned the program in your head, and then you sat down and wrote the code.\n\n\nThe programs people write these days are far too complicated for that. Graphical user interfaces, interacting with servers on the Internet, internationalization, security against malware attacks, and many more requirements are part of a serious software development effort, and a program is likely to have hundreds of authors.\n\n\nThis means that collaboration skills are as important as coding skills today. Even if you don’t end up working as a programmer, collaboration is part of most jobs.\n\n\nCRD-1.B.2\n\n\nThere are several ways to organize a collaboration. In this course, you’ll use a collaboration technique called pair programming—writing computer programs in teams of two. One partner, the driver, controls the computer. The other, the navigator, helps catch errors and keeps track of how the code being written fits into the overall plan. The navigator is also in charge of reading the lab pages out loud. Aim for equal time in each role, switching about every five minutes.\n\n\n\nHow not to do pair programming:\n\n\nThe biggest mistake in pair programming is for the navigator to tune out and let the driver do all the work. The navigator has to be paying attention; otherwise you’re just taking turns doing the entire work instead of making use of the benefits of having two people.\n\n\n\nHow to collaborate in pair programming\n\n\nCRD-1.C.1:\n\n\ncommunication - Keep talking, Listen\n\n\nconsensus building - Don’t bargain\n\n\nconflict resolution - Don’t get defensive, Don’t be afraid of conflict\n\n\nnegotiation - Don’t bargain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep talking. The driver should constantly explain the reason for using each block. The navigator should interrupt with questions: What about doing it this other way? How does this program avoid such-and-such bug? Don’t we have to deal with this requirement and that requirement at the same time? We’re pretty much repeating this other piece of code over there; could we hide that code in a block and use the same block in both places? And so on.\n\n\nListen. Try to understand each other’s thinking before you disagree.\n\n\nWork as a team. If you find yourself being defensive about feedback, remember that nobody’s code is perfect right away. It’s the navigator’s job to find problems in the driver’s code, and when you switch places, the new navigator will repay the favor. You’re a team, not a competition.\n\n\nWork toward consensus. Don’t bargain; if you have disagreements about how something should be done, don’t say “well, you can do this your way if I can have this other thing my way.” Both partners should listen to each other’s reasons and work together to find a solution that meets both needs.\n\n\nSpeak your mind and work out your differences. That doesn’t mean you should try to disagree, but if you do, you can still be friends. Work out the conflict by listening and understanding each other, rather than by giving in just to end the argument.\n\n\nRegardless of experience, take turns. Don’t let the more experienced programmer overwhelm the other partner. Make sure both partners are comfortable contributing, in either role. A group is almost always better at problem-solving than any of the people in the group is alone.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first unit, we’ll use these symbols to remind you to switch roles at specific points in the lab. After this unit, you’re on your own to be sure to switch about every five minutes.  \n\n\n\nCRD-1.C\n\n\n\nYour teacher will hand out instructions for the Lost on the Moon game."

The most basic kind of abstraction is to give a name to something in a program. For example, here we gave the name who to the idea “pick an item at random from this list of people (or cats).” This is called procedural abstraction because we use a procedure (a block) to name the idea. This makes your code readable. You’ll see other kinds of abstraction later.\n\n\n\nAAP-3.B.7\n\n\nIf you find yourself wanting to copy and paste code from one place to another without changing it, then give it a name (open a Block Editor and paste the code there) and call your procedure in both places.

A string is a sequence of characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.). A substring is just a piece of some existing string. For example, “Hanna,” “anna”, and “nnah” are each substrings of the string “Hannah.” (The empty string as well as the original string are both also substrings.)\n\n\nTo concatenate strings means to make a bigger string by connecting two or more smaller strings. In Snap!, the  block lets you concatenate strings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process of testing, finding problems, and fixing them is called debugging.\n\n\n\nMake sure your program works. Test each block as well as the program as a whole.

They tell the computer to do something without reporting a value.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-3.A.7, AAP-3.C.2\n\n\nThe procedure  would be written as\n\nPROCEDURE double(x)\n{\nRETURN(2 * x)\n}\n\nor .\n\nMany languages (and the AP CS Principles Exam) use return instead of report as the name of the command to give a value back at the end of a function call.\n\n\n\nAAP-3.A.9\n\n\nThe exam uses “value of a procedure” to mean the value the procedure returns when called. For example, “the value of\ndouble(5)\n” means 10.\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your custom gossip response block by clicking it several times. It should behave like the who, does what, and who 2 blocks. Debug any problems before moving on.\n\n\nReview how to edit a block in Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Customizing and Debugging, if needed.\n\n\nUse your new block: Edit gossip 2, and insert gossip response in place of the text “Oh, but….” \n\n\n\nWhy do I see plus signs around gossip 2 in Snap! but they’re not in this picture?\n\n\nNormally, when you are using the Block Editor, you see plus signs because you have to click on them to add inputs to your blocks. But to show you the finished code here, it looks cleaner without the plus signs.\n\n\n\nTest and debug gossip 2 also.\n\n\nThen test the whole program by clicking script D several times, and fix any bugs."

The algorithm doesn’t have to be written in any particular programming language or even in a programming language at all; you can write your algorithm in English or any other human language. Some people call an algorithm written in human language pseudocode. Once you know the steps that the computer will take, you can code your algorithm in the programming language of your choice.\n\n\nWhat’s the purpose of “pseudocode”? Why write an algorithm vaguely in English when you could write it precisely in Snap!? If you were programming in a punctuation-heavy language, designing your program in pseudocode would help you focus on the important ideas instead of on details like quotation marks and semicolons. But pseudocode isn’t as necessary with a language like Snap!, and pseudocode can make it easy for you to fall into wishful thinking about what the computer is capable of (such as writing “Pick tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers” or “Here’s the melody; write the harmony”).\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.A, AAP-3.A part b\n\n\n\n  Describe what this algorithm will make the sprite do: \n\n\nLog in to Snap! and build that script to test your hypothesis.\n\n\nClick it, and watch what the sprite does.\n\n\nClick , and then click your script to run it again.\n\n\n\n\nYou can click pen down (or any block) in the palette on the left or in the scripting area to run it. If you click a block inside a script, the whole script runs.\n\n\n Analyze why that script does what it does.\n\n\nCompare your work with another pair. If your script behaves differently from theirs, check both.\n\n\n\nUsing Visible Stepping\n\n\nSnap! has a tool called Visible Stepping that allows you to control how quickly Snap! steps through the blocks of your code.\n\n\n\nClick the Visible Stepping button (), and adjust the slider to control the stepping speed. When you run your code, the sprite will slowly execute each step of the code and highlight it in cyan.\n\nClick for a video of adjusting the Visible Stepping slider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can slow the stepping to do only one step at a time and wait until you tell Snap! to go on to the next one. Move the slider all the way to the left, and then you can press the Run/Pause button () to see what happens at each step of your code.\n\nClick for a video of single-stepping through code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisible stepping can be useful as you read someone else’s code because you can watch it at human speed instead of computer speed. It’s also useful in debugging (fixing problems with) your own code when it’s doing something wrong.\n\n\n\n Switch who is sitting at the keyboard. Then experiment:\n\n\nYou can put your sprite back in the center of the screen with  and you can reset the direction it’s pointing with .\n\n\nChange 100 to 50 in the move block of your script by clicking on the 100 and typing 50. Then click the script again to run it with the new input value.\n\n\nClick the  block in the green Pen palette.\n\n\nChange the number in the turn block and run the script again… and again… and again.\n\n\nClear the stage again, and change the number in the  block.\n\n\nExperiment with the input numbers in the turn and repeat blocks. Try to draw a triangle with equal sides.\n\n\nUse  to set the pen size to something like 4 or 10 or 50. Then click your repeat, move, turn script again.\n\n\nTo change the pen size you must click the set pen size block to run it after you’ve entered the number you want.\n\n\nUse  to experiment with the pen color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment: What leaves a trace?\n\n\nMove the sprite by dragging it to a new location. Does it leave a trace as you move it?\n\n\nMove the sprite by clicking on . Does it leave a trace as it moves?\n\n\nDoes clicking  leave a trace?\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your other work has been saved, then  Experiment with the scripts and look inside them to figure out how they work. Could you change the sizes or colors to make it more interesting?\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nSolid rectangles. Make and run this script:  The light blue set block is in the Sensing palette, where it looks like . Just click once in the hexagonal slot to get True (the green check box). If you’re not sure what difference the “flat line ends” makes, try clicking the hexagonal slot again to run the script with that option False. And of course you can change all the numbers, or have your program pick random numbers.\n\n\nColor families. Click the file menu icon and select “Libraries…” Then, find the “Colors and Crayons” library and click “Import.”   In the Pen menu you’ll find the set pen to crayon block. Computers can display billions of colors, but unless you have to match the paint on your wall very precisely, finding your way through all those colors may be more trouble than it’s worth. The crayon library, just like a box of crayons, gives you a small set of vibrant colors, arranged in families. So if you want a lot of browns in your picture, you could pick a random number between 30 and 39. \n\n\n\nAt the right is a painting by Kazimir Malevich. Its elements are rectangles, either horizontal or at a 45-degree angle, plus or minus a few degrees. You can position rectangles randomly. Your picture doesn’t have to look like his—you’re the artist!\n\n\nAlphie: If we just put rectangles in randomly, the tiny square dots will often be covered by larger ones. Maybe we should do big ones first and smaller ones later.\n\n\nGamal: I know ours don’t have to look like the original, but I really like that huge black horizontal rectangle. It gives the painting a structure, with a top part and a bottom part, even though it doesn’t go all the way across. I want to make sure to have one like that.\n\n\nBetsy: I bet we can use the idea of drawing really thick lines without using flat line ends and get interesting results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the right is a painting by Theo van Doesburg. It has some things in common with the Malevich picture, mainly the use of rectangles as the design elements. But there are no 45-degree rectangles; instead, the constraint is that rectangles may not overlap, so if you want to place a random rectangle in the picture, each end may have to be shortened to avoid collisions. You can use  to find out if the point behind the sprite’s rotation center is black."

    "text": "On this page, you will learn about sprite turning angles, which are needed for drawing polygons. For starters, you’ll draw various asterisks, like these:    \n\n\n\nWhen you were trying to draw an equilateral triangle on the previous page, you might have tried code like this:  and seen a result like this:  It’s common to try this if you’ve learned that the angles in an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees. However, the angle that the sprite needs to turn to make a triangle is actually 120 degrees, and it’s important to understand why that is and how to find the correct angle for other polygons (five-sided, eleven-sided, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform the four experiments (A-D), and read the comments attached to each one. As you do, talk with your partner about what you see and why it happens.\n\n\nThen, experiment with the last script (shown right): \n\n\nExperiment with a quarter turn (turn 90 degrees instead of 180). Adjust the number of repetitions (the number you give to repeat) until you get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started. \n\n\nExperiment with a tenth of a turn (turn 36 degrees). What input must you give to repeat to get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started?\n\n\nWithout trying it on the computer, figure out what turning angle to use for a five-spoke asterisk. Make sure your partner agrees.\n\n\nThen, try the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n Describe what you’ve learned about turning angles.\n\n\nAt the top of the page you were thinking about triangles. As a step in that direction, make a three-spoke asterisk.\n\nClick for a hint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that (180°) is a half turn. A fourth of 360°  is a quarter turn. You don’t have to do the division yourself. Snap! can compute it for you. You can use  or  to get a seventh of a turn or a third of a turn.\n\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of this page, you knew that to make a triangle you need 120° turns, but maybe you weren’t sure why. Now you know why a three-spoke asterisk takes 120° turns, but what does that have to do with triangles?\n\n\n\n\nTry different negative input values for the move -100 steps block (first -90, then -50, then -10), and do some of the turning experiments (above) with each value. Does this change the values needed for the repeat or turn blocks? These pictures are called “pinwheels.”\n\n\n\nNow, run script (A) in the file and experiment:\n\n\nChange the inputs in script A to draw an asterisk with:\n\n\n5 branches\n\n\n8 branches\n\n\n3 branches\n\n\n\n\nMake a copy of the three-branch script you built (right-click or control-click the script, and choose “duplicate”).\n\n\nIn the copy, remove the move -100 steps block.\n\n\nWhat does this new script do?\n\n\n\n\nMake another copy of the three-branch script you built, and then:\n\n\nChange it to a four-branch script.\n\n\nRemove the move -100 steps block again.\n\n\nWhat does this new script do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging with  \n\n\nYou can use say for to get information about the state of your program while it’s running.\n\n\nThis animation shows how to use say for to determine the bug in code that is supposed to draw a rectangle. Notice how say for makes the program pause and gives you information to help you identify the source of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript B in the same file shows how you can make a 60-branch script behave like the second hand of a clock. Try it out.\n\n\n\nBe sure you are able to explain how this script does what it does.\n\n\nWhy is the change in pen color and size useful here? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\nAt the right is a painting by Alma Thomas. See what it inspires you to do. It’s your art. Take liberties.\n\n\nGamal: It looks like a map. Houses on the left, the town center on the right, with City Hall and the fire station and the mall.\n\n\nBetsy: Maybe. To me the part on the left looks a little like a fingerprint, and the part on the right is clearly a person facing right, with her nose up against the right edge, halfway down.\n\n\nAlphie: Never mind what it looks like. How are we going to make something that looks like it?\n\n\nBetsy: Parts of it look like curved, thick dotted lines. We could do something like this:        But I’m not sure how to get a bunch of those to fit together.\n\n\nAlphie: Randomness is your friend. Let’s make a bunch of your lines, all different, and just point them in different directions.       \n\n\nBetsy: Wow! That’s very cool.\n\n\nAlphie: Nothing like what it’s supposed to look like, though.\n\n\nBetsy: What do you mean, “supposed”? Go read the boldface line up above this blue box again.\n\n\nAlphie: Yeah, I know, but “take liberties” doesn’t mean “take whatever happens on your first try.” I have another idea. We’ve been thinking of Thomas’s picture as brown boxes on a white background, but it’s actually more brown than white. What if we start with a brown background and draw white lines on it?\n\n\nGamal: What about that town center on the right?\n\n\nBetsy: It’s not a map. But to make you happy, when drawing white lines over toward the right, we can make them thicker, so the right part will have more white space than the left part.\n\n\nAlphie: Uh oh… If you look carefully at the original picture, the brown boxes aren’t all the same shade of brown.\n\n\nBetsy: Alphie, you worry too much. But to make you happy, once we have the space divided into brown regions, we can  some of them in different colors.\n\n\nGamal: Hey! Gang! Remember we imported that crayon library? Guess what! There’s a “World Map” library, too! And it makes “watercolor” maps like this:  And then I went over every dot on the stage using  and  to decide whether to make each dot white or brown: \n\n\n\n\nWhat did Alma Thomas intend by her painting: a map, a fingerprint, or something else?

    "text": "On this page, you will use inputs to allow one block to do many things.\n\n\n\nOn the previous page you used blocks asterisk and pinwheel that we wrote for you, each with an input for the number of spokes. Now you’re going to learn how to create your own blocks with inputs.\n\n\n\n\n Make 5 copies of the script and modify those copies so that they make pinwheel designs like these with 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 branches.     \n\n\nLook at two of your scripts, and write down all of the differences between them.\n\n\n\n\nCRD-2.B.3 (white text)\n\n\nThe scripts are essentially all the same; only some of the input values change. Instead of having many separate scripts, you can make one general block  that will draw all such designs. The block has to work for a variety of inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a pinwheel block with an input for the number of branches. Instructions are below and you can also watch the process in the video that follows the instructions.\n\n\nMaking a Block with an Input\n\n\n\nCreate a new block, type the block name and the label for your input, and click OK. For this project, type pinwheel, branches:.\n\nClick for an image of naming the new block.\n\n\n\nThis block is about moving your sprite, so you might choose the blue Motion palette.\n\n\nUsing a comma and a colon are not requirements; they are here to help with clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the + (plus sign) after “branches:”, type the name of the input, and click OK to add the input slot. For this project, click the + after “branches:” and type number of branches as the name of your input.\n\nClick for images of naming the input.\n\n \n\n\n\n The picture of a blue pinwheel block inside the hat block is called the prototype of the block. As you add inputs and maybe title text to the prototype, it looks exactly like what the finished block will look like to the user, except that where the input slots go, there are orange ovals containing the names of the inputs.\n\n\n\nDrag in the blocks you need, and use the new input.\n\n\nIn this project, drag one of your pinwheel scripts into the Block Editor and snap it to the pinwheel hat block.\n\n\nThen, drag the new input number of branches in to replace the values that change to allow for more general use of the script.\n\n\n\nClick for an image of setting up the code inside the Block Editor.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for a video of of the whole process of building the pinwheel block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDAT-1.A.1\n\n\nWhat kind of data can be an input? All kinds of data. In this example, the input is supposed to be a number, but any kind of value can be used as an input. For instance, you’ve seen the list block called with text as inputs. In Snap!, any kind of data can be used as an input, can be reported by a block, or can be put in a list.\n\n\n\n: What’s an input? Parameter vs. Argument\n\nAAP-3.A.3\n\n\n\n\nA parameter (or formal parameter) is the input name, such as number of branches. The input name is set in the block definition. It never changes. \n\n\nAn argument (or actual argument) is the input value, such as 6 for a hexagonal pinwheel. The input value is given each time the block is run; it can be a different value each time. \n\n\nWe use the word “input” both for parameters (input names) and for arguments (input values).\n\n\n\nAAP-3.B.4\n\n\nOriginally, you made five copies of the pinwheel script to create five slightly different pinwheels. Now, you’ve made a single procedure that includes the shared features of these five scripts and uses a parameter to handle the differences.\n\n\n\nCRD-2.G\n\n\n\n\nComment your code.\n\n\n\nDebugging Tip: Commenting Your Code\n\n\nCRD-2.G.2\n\n\nAdding comments to your code may help you remember what your code does, helps other people reading your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program. But it won’t do any of those things if you comment every line of code, so each comment just says how a block inside your script works. You can add comments to your Snap! code by right-clicking (or control-clicking) in the Scripts area and choosing “add comment.” Click for an animation that shows how.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can attach a comment to the hat block in the Block Editor to create a help message for your block. This is the best way to comment, because people can find out what your block does without having to look inside, just like the help messages for primitive blocks.\n\n\n\nBad commenting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood commenting:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPart of the reason some people emphasize the importance of detailed comments is that they are programming in text languages, which discourage long variable and procedure names. (Typically, you can’t include spaces in the names, and you have to type the entire name every time you use that variable or procedure.) So you see names like substLcUc instead of substitute lower case letters for capital letters in string. If a program is full of drastically abbreviated names for procedures and variables, it’s no surprise if the code needs documentation. In Snap!, the names in the program can be self-documenting.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore About Program Documentation\n\n\nCRD-2.G.1, CRD-2.G.5\n\n\nCommenting is only one form of documentation. It’s not the best form, because attaching a comment to a particular place in the program documents only that one procedure or code segment, and doesn’t explain how different sections of the program interact. But commenting is an easy way to document small details.\n\n\nDocumentation can be external (written for users of the program) or internal (written for yourself or other developers of the program). Both kinds are important, if it’s a program people other than the author are going to use. Usually they should be separate documents—another reason why comments aren’t the best form of documentation.\n\n\nCRD-2.G.4\n\n\nIf you’re writing a program by yourself, internal documentation may seem silly. “I know how my own program works.” But if the program will still be in use a year later, it will probably need maintenance, and you may well have forgotten the details of its implementation. In a programming class like this one, most of the programs you write are very small, and you can understand them at a glance. But real programs are generally much bigger than lab exercises designed to take less than an hour of work.\n\n\nCRD-2.G.3\n\n\nIt’s best if the first attempt at documentation is made even before starting to code. The documentation will specify the desired program behavior (external) and the intended program structure (internal). These documents can be used in testing the code to ensure that it behaves as planned.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-3.A part a\n\n\nCreate a script that draws two pinwheels on the stage, with different numbers of spokes.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-3.A.4\n\n\nWhen you embed a command procedure (such as pinwheel) within a script, the procedure is completed before continuing the script that called it.\n\n\n\n\nThese images were created with the pinwheel block and set pen color.

You can use the clean up option by right-clicking (or control-clicking on a Mac) in the scripting area to organize your blocks. You can remove a block or script either by dragging it out of the scripting area and back to the palettes on the left or by choosing the “delete” option from the drop-down menu. Click here for a video. (Note that this is different from the “delete block definition” option which will permanently delete a custom block and all its instances from your entire project.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy up the code in your project, if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-3.A.5\n\n\nThis instruction  would be written as\nPinwheel(6, 80, 20)\nor .\n\n\nYou may hear people use the term “pseudocode” to refer to this pseudo-language used on the AP CS Principles exam, but it’s not pseudocode. Pseudocode isn’t a programming language at all, it’s the use of normal human language to describe an algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind inputs to pinwheel that make the result look like a circle.\n\n\n\n\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\nOn the right is a painting by Vassily Kandinsky. The four pictures above were inspired by it, but the sizes and placement of the circles in the original were carefully chosen, whereas the ones above are random. Also, Kandinsky’s solid circles aren’t quite uniform in color. For example, the green circle near the top right of the picture has a light green outer border, a somewhat darker green inside, a blue-green inner border, and black inside that.\n\nWhen two solid circles overlap, you can see both colors, or rather, a color in between the two. To achieve that effect in Snap!, before drawing the second circle, use the  block. A transparency of 0 means you see only the new color; a transparency of 100 means you see only the old color. In-between values determine which color is stronger in the overlapping area.\n\nMost of Kandinsky’s circles are solid, but a few aren’t. most notably the large white “halo” near the middle of the painting. His hollow circles don’t have a constant width; if you want yours to look like his, change the pen size a little as you’re drawing. But of course you don’t have to make your art look exactly like his, nor exactly like the examples above. Use them for inspiration, but you’re the artist.\n\n\nMake a picture that looks more like a real pinwheel:\n Copyright 2010 Victoria Hudgins. Used by permission.\n\n(Save your project first; you’ll need the pinwheel block you already have later.)\n\n\nIt doesn’t have to look exactly like the photo. But each arm of a pinwheel is essentially two triangles. You may find the  block helpful."

The pause all block will pause every script that is running until the yellow Run/Pause button is clicked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn page Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk, you learned about procedural abstraction: giving a code segment a name (making it a block). That way you can call it more than once instead of copying and pasting.\n\n\n\nAAP-3.B.4\n\n\nHere is another kind of abstraction: noticing that asterisk and polygon are both kinds of pinwheels, and writing one, more general, pinwheel block that uses an input so that the block can be used to make asterisks, polygons, or other interesting designs.\n\n\nAAP-3.B.5\n\n\nThis is an example of abstraction by generalization: looking at chunks of code that are almost the same and writing a single block by using an input to distinguish among the different cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look inside of pinwheel and see how you’re using it in polygon, you’ll see that there are steps that you don’t really need for the case of a polygon.

You can use  to keep track, and you can use its counter (the default name is ) in the repeated script. For example, the for block lets you simplify long scripts like:  \n      to\n\n\n\nEach time the for block runs the script inside, it changes the value of the counter by 1, beginning with the first input number and ending after the second.\n\n\nThe for block’s default counter name,  stands for “index.” You can change this name by clicking it. To use the counter, drag it into the script.\n\n\n\n\nBuild this script that makes the sprite say the numbers 1 through 10.  \n\n\nThen modify it so that the sprite says 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, … up through 30.\n\n\nDiscuss your solutions with another pair.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment with spirals.\n\n\nBuild this script and try it out:\n\nThis design got the nickname “squiral” because it’s a square spiral.\n\n\n\n\n Make sure you can explain why the squiral spirals outward.\n\n\nTry switching the order of the 100 and the 1 in the for block in the squiral script. What is the result?\n\n\nTry changing the turning angle in the squiral script to other numbers such as 92, 126, etc.\n\n\nChange the inputs to turn and move to get as close as you can get to a smooth spiral: \n\n\n\n\n\n“U1L3-Squiral”\n\n\n\nOpen your U1L3-Pinwheel project, and build a nest squares block that uses for and your polygon block to draw nested squares.

This can make the pictures more interesting to someone who doesn’t share Albers’s interest in subtle differences in color. (Albers himself, in fact, had more color variation in other pictures of this type.) Too much randomness, though, can make the picture less interesting. Compare the last two examples above; the left one of those two is clearly based on the orange family, with rainbow-neighbors red and yellow, but the right one has violets, greens, oranges, a yellow—too much chaos, maybe. Look back at the Gossip project if you don’t remember how to choose something special once out of six times, or once out of 14 times. Other random choices you can make are the number of squares, how much to shrink the size from one square to the next, and how much to move the corner of the next square horizontally and vertically (the picture is more interesting if those two numbers are different, so the smallest square isn’t exactly in the center).\n\n\n\n   This block is like the squiral, but instead of changing the input to move, it changes the input to turn: \n\n\nTry sketching what it will draw with an angle of 2.\n\n\nThen build it, and try each of these tests:\n\nYou can stop each test with the stop button  when you’re sure nothing new will happen, but don’t decide that too quickly!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s going on? Can you work out a theory to predict anything about the shape it draws for a particular angle input? (Don’t click unless you need a big hint.)\n\nHint: Think about divisibility."

Posting a picture of you and your friends to a website reveals information about where you were and what you were doing. This may violate both your own privacy and that of your friends. If your phone is lost or stolen, someone else might get access to pictures or messages you thought were private. That’s why data on cell phones is normally encrypted so it can’t be recovered without your password. Having to type your password is a trade-off between convenience and security. But some recent research has shown that cell phone apps are often written to collect information about you and your contacts and location without your knowledge, mostly to sell targeted advertising.\n\n\nIOC-2.A.8, IOC-2.A.9, IOC-2.A.12\n\n\nHaving PII shared online can have benefits. For example, it can be used to show you personalized movie recommendations or simplify online purchasing by suggesting things you are likely to buy based on previous purchases. Shared PII also has risks: It can be used for identity theft, harassment, kidnapping, fraud, etc.\n\n\nDon’t be too afraid of the criminal possibilities. Sharing information online is like crossing the street: Don’t be afraid to do it, but do it carefully.\n\n\n\n\n Discuss: What kind of digital information is out there about you?\n\n\nWith a partner, list the kinds of information someone might be able to find out about you by searching on the Internet.\n\n\nWhich of these things are information that you voluntarily put online?\n\n\nWhich of these things would you prefer to keep private?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason you are asked to choose a username when you get a Snap! account is to give you the freedom to express political or personal issues without tying those conversations to your actual identity.\n\n\nBrian, look up CA law. -bh\n\n\n\nBrian, I cut the following because that symbol appears very rarely in the curriculum, and it was a lot of reading for something we hardly use. Instead, I just used the word next to the icon in the displayed yellow box below. All students need to know is that yellow is optional. –MF, 8/19/21\n\n\nWhen you see this symbol in a yellow box:  it means that what’s in the box isn’t something you have to read right now to be able to complete the lab, or to pass the AP exam, but it’s something we think might be interesting to you. Click the link to see the text. Don’t confuse that symbol with this other one:  which means we want you to write something in your journal.\n\nThe point of this yellow box is to distinguish a yellow box for good students (these ones) from a yellow box for struggling students (hints). The reason it’s not widely used in the curriculum is that I’ve barely begun the process of adding this symbol everywhere it belongs. -bh\n\nI think that’s a problematic distinction. Who decides who a “good” student is? Kids get labeled as “good student” or “bad student” and then are treated differently for it and take it on as an identity rather than everyone treating it for all it really can be: someone’s observation of how well they have been studying lately. And any student can benefit from a hint from time to time. We should discuss this in a meeting sometime. I might not mind what you are trying to do here, but I do mind that characterization. –MF, 8/20/21\n\n\n\n What laws exist to protect PII?\n\n\nUnited States law says that websites must have a privacy policy that spells out what the site will do with the information you give them. This is a pretty weak protection; the privacy policies are typically really long, and written in ways that make it hard to find out what information is collected and what is done with it. In Europe, there is now a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that defines what counts as PII, and limits what websites can do without your affirmative permission—a definite “yes” from you, not just not saying “no”—regardless of what they put in their privacy policies. These regulations also state that the website cannot deny you otherwise free services because you refused to permit the use they want you to agree to.\n\n\nThe GDPR is new enough that its implications are still being worked out. For example, to get a Snap! account, you must provide an email address, your own or your parent’s depending on your age. That’s the only thing Snap! knows about you: not your name, not your home address, just your email address. Is that PII? Some lawyers think it is. Other lawyers think that your email alone isn’t PII, but it is when combined with certain other information. If it’s PII, then Snap! must ask if you’re in Europe; if so, must collect more information, such as your name, age, and address, to satisfy some GDPR requirements. Your age matters because the rules are different for children and adults. (In Europe, the cutoff age is 16; in the US, we must ask for your parent’s email if you’re below 13.) We need that other PII because if you ask to have your account deleted, we must do so at once, so we have to be able to make sure that it’s really you, or your parent, asking, not somebody wanting to delete your account as a prank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of some website on which you have an account. It can be one of the huge ones, such as Google, Facebook, or Amazon, or it can be a site associated with a store, a TV show, or a game.\n\n\nHow do you connect to that site when you’re using a computer?\n\n\nHow do you connect to the site using your cell phone?\n\n\nCompare your answers with other students.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a privacy point of view, using a browser is much better. If you’re like most people, when you are on a computer you use a web browser (such as Chrome, Safari, Edge) to connect to all websites you visit. But on your phone, you may have a separate app installed for some sites (such as Instagram or Facebook).\n\n\n Why does it matter how you connect?\n\n\n\nIn a browser, you can install privacy extensions (such as AdBlockPlus, Ghostery, or NoScript) that restrict the ability of websites to gather your information. Site-specific apps do not let you limit what they collect.\n\n\nWhen you exit from a computer’s browser, it stops running. (This doesn’t have to be true, but when a browser company tries to get around that rule, someone catches them and people stop using that browser for a while.) But almost all phone apps keep running even when you’re not using them, and many are constantly accessing your contacts, messages, and other data and sending that information over the Internet to the company that made the app. That company may even be in a country with very weak privacy protection.\n\n\nOn a computer, your information is generally stored on the computer’s own hard drive. Phones generally store your information in “the cloud,” i.e., on computers belonging to your cell phone carrier (Verizon, ATT, etc.) or the phone manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, Google, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Discuss these questions, and write down answers with as much detail as possible.\n\n\nWhat does Google know about you?\n\n\nWhat does your cell phone carrier know about you?\n\n\nWhat does Facebook know about you?\n\n\nWhat does the US government know about you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIOC-2.A.7\n\n\n“What does organization X know about you?” is kind of a trick question because many these companies and institutions share the information they collect about you. This kind of data sharing is important—and problematic—because different kinds of information, while possibly unimportant by themselves, can become a serious privacy problem when combined. For example, your cell phone carrier knows every place you go and Google knows what people or businesses live at every address; in combination, these two kinds of information can reveal whether you’ve visiting a divorce lawyer, an AIDS doctor, or other possibilities that could be embarrassing (or worse) if revealed.\n\n\nThere are even companies whose sole business is to collect information about you from other companies, large or small, that you use online. (One of the authors looked himself up at Acxiom, one of those companies, and  here’s what he found. The information circled in red is incorrect.) But the biggest data gatherers are Google, cell phone carriers, Facebook, and governments, such as the US government or the Chinese government."

(If you use an iPhone, then it’s Apple that collects your contacts and calendar).\n\n\n\n\nIOC-2.A.6\n\n\nWhat does Google do with the information it collects about you? One thing is to choose ads that they think you’ll click on. Less obvious, and worse, it decides which search results to show you.\n\n\nThey do this mainly so you’ll see how easy it is to get results you want. For example, if you always order books from Amazon, but your friend always orders from Barnes & Noble, then when you search for the same book, you’ll get Amazon as the first link and your friend will get Barnes & Noble. That may not be a problem, but this is: If I get news from the liberal New York Times, and you read the conservative Fox News, then, over time, I’ll see only ideas I already agree with, and you’ll see only the ones you already agree with, very different from mine. This situation is called a search bubble. We’re stuck in two different bubbles. That’s not because Google wants to prevent us seeing each other’s ideas, but because the same algorithms that give each of us our favorite bookstore also gives each of us our favorite news source.\n\n\n\n\nAs a class, choose a politically controversial topic. Then, not in class but on the computer you usually use outside of school (so that your Google dossier is connected with that computer), do a search for that topic. Save the results you get, and at next class meeting see if everyone got the same results.\n\n\n\n\nIOC-2.A.8\n\n\nBoth targeted advertising and search bubbles can be viewed as in your interest. If you must see advertising, isn’t it better to see advertising that’s likely to feel relevant? If Google knows where you are right now, it can suggest nearby restaurants you like, or ones similar to ones you like (and that pay Google for promoting them). The same reasoning applies to other big tech companies. Don’t you want Netflix to recommend things you might like to watch?\n\n\nPeople may really like targeting, up to a point, but not beyond. For example, some are happy with “Hey, it’s lunch time and you’re near Café Gratitude, where you’ve eaten before. Should I call them and order your usual?” but find “… and your friend Paul is there right now” creepy.\n\n\n\n\n Discuss: Have you ever had that “creepy” feeling about something your phone knew about you?\n\n\n\n\nIOC-2.A.9\n\n\nMany people find it convenient that sites that sell things, such as Amazon, remember your credit card number so you don’t have to type it in every time. Similarly, most people are happy for their browser to remember their password for each website. But credit card numbers and passwords are among the PII that you most want to keep protected against thieves. You’re relying on the seller or the company that makes your browser not to have any security bugs, and you’re also relying on them not to misuse your PII themselves.\n\n\nIOC-1.F.11 3rd bullet, IOC-2.A.4, IOC-2.A.14\n\n\nYour cell phone carrier is the biggest threat to your online privacy because it sees everything you do on your phone. You can choose the search engine you use, but you have few choices of cell phone carrier; it’s probably ATT, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile. A particularly important kind of information that your phone knows is your physical location. You can turn off sharing your location with other companies, but you can’t block your carrier from knowing your location; it needs to know which cell tower you’re using and where that tower is. The information it has isn’t just your location right now, but everywhere you’ve been since you got that phone.\n\n\nIOC-2.A.3, IOC-2.A.11, IOC-2.A.13, IOC-2.A.15\n\n\nYou may think if you don’t have a Facebook account, Facebook knows nothing about you, but Facebook keeps dossiers even on non-users. It finds out about you because a friend who is on Facebook has you as a contact in their phone, or because your friend posted a photo that includes you, perhaps from an email you intended for that person alone. (Facebook doesn’t even need your name with the photo, because it has a massive database of photographed faces and names.) And once the information is on the net, many people may keep or redistribute copies (e.g., “retweeting”), so it becomes impossible to delete all the copies of the information from the Internet. Of course, every website records who visited it, but if the site has a “Like” button, Facebook also knows who visited it—even if they don’t click the button. And the special danger of social media sites like Facebook is that anyone can read the information shown, not just the big tech companies.\n\n\n\nIOC-2.A\n\n\n\nDiscuss:\n\n\nWhat are some reasons for giving up privacy in certain areas? Identify one area in your life in which you purposely give up privacy.\n\n\nNeed some examples?\n\n\nHere are a few reasons people give up privacy:\n\n\nSome website you want to visit requires you to sign up, and sends you an email to verify that it’s really you.\n\n\nYou gain convenience from tailored ads and location services.\n\n\nPeople today care more about online friendships.\n\n\nGovernments need to protect us against bad guys.\n\n\nBusinesses must verify eligibility (e.g., credit scores).\n\n\n“If I’m doing nothing wrong, I have nothing to hide.”\n\n\n\n\n\n                    <li><strong>What are the risks?</strong> Why have <em>you</em> decided that the benefits outweigh the risks?</li>\n\n\n\n\n\nIOC-2.A.10\n\n\nIn the early days of the Internet, the hackers who designed it didn’t trust the government, so they tried to make sure that the police couldn’t get your browsing history without a warrant signed by a judge. That all changed on 9/11/2001, when the World Trade Center was destroyed by hijacked airplanes crashing into its towers. Congress quickly passed the “Patriot Act,” a huge collection of permissions for police and other government agencies to collect data about you. These days, many experts believe that the Patriot Act went too far in weakening privacy, but it’s very hard to change it because politicians are afraid that if they vote to remove some of the privacy holes in the law, their opponents will say they’re weak on terrorism.\n\n\nIOC-2.A.10\n\n\nAnother big change in our understanding of the government’s interest in the Internet came in 2013, when Edward Snowden, working for a contractor with the National Security Agency (NSA), leaked a large collection of NSA internal documents showing how the NSA and other agencies “listen in” on your digital conversations and actions, often illegally even under the loose Patriot Act rules. This led to widespread disapproval of the U.S. government spying on Americans (instead of spying on other countries, which is their job) and also raised concerns in other countries. This is economically important because people outside the U.S. don’t want to do business with companies that store data in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n Discuss: What are some reasons for protecting your privacy? Why is privacy a good thing?\n\nNeed some examples?\n\n\nHere are a few of many reasons for protecting privacy:\n\n\nAvoid discrimination (e.g., based on HIV status)\n\n\nAllow anonymous political speech\n\n\nProtect personal security (e.g., against stalkers)\n\n\nRestrain exercise of state power (e.g., require warrants)\n\n\nPrevent spread of incorrect information\n\n\nPart of human dignity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIOC-2.A.5\n\n\nDiscuss: Who is threatening your privacy?\n\nDescribe how each of the following threatens privacy:\n\n\nGovernments\n\n\nCorporations\n\n\nPeople with cellphone cameras"

Sometimes for example, people disappear to hide from people who might hurt them. When a person is reported missing, the police can’t assume that’s the whole story; they have to follow the rules even if that delays some rescues. Also, maybe that person is trying to avoid the police!\n\n\nPosition B: The police should be able to check the location of a phone right away to search for a missing person, perhaps with a rule that they can’t use the information for any other purpose, or disclose it to anyone, without permission from a court.\n\n\nIs there a third policy that protects everyone’s needs?"

One sprite will follow your mouse. The other sprite will chase the first. When they meet, they will have a short conversation.\n\n\n\nOn this page, you will program the first sprite to follow your mouse and program the second sprite to point in the direction of the first sprite in preparation for following it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiana Macias, an American born of Mexican parents, manages a team of 20 engineers that design visual elements for Twitter (GIFs, stickers, and polls). She is the co-founder of Twitter Able, a group at Twitter for disabled employees and allies, and has served as the co-chair of Twitter’s Latinx group, Twitter Alas.

File menu, .\n\n\nClick “Yes” to open a new project (and close the open one).\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose “Save As…” from the Snap! File menu, .\n\n\nType the project name.\n\n\nClick the “Save” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n Read and think about this script before you build it. What do you expect it to do? \n\n\nNow build the script and run it. Move your mouse around the stage while the program is running. What does the forever block do?\n\nTo stop your script, click the red stop sign: \n\n\n\nDoes the program work the way you expected?\n\n\n\n\nProgramming a Second Sprite\n\n\n\n\nCreate a second sprite by clicking on the  button just below the stage.  \n\nThe new sprite, automatically named Sprite(2), appears on the stage. It’s brand new, so it has no scripts.

Here’s the idea:\n\nFill the input slot in the move block with a small number so Follower doesn’t catch Leader too quickly.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.K.5\n\n\nWhat happens if the sprites are already touching? That is, what happens if you drag one sprite on top of the other and then click the green flag? Why?\n\n\nAAP-2.K.4\n\n\nExperiment. What happens if the input to move is 0?\n\n\n\n\nWhen a program keeps running forever, that’s called an infinite loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.K.3\n\n\n\nThe language used on the AP Exam doesn’t allow spaces in names of inputs (such as number of fish) or in programmer-defined procedures (such as mouse y, which isn’t built into their language). So this example translates them to\nnumFish\nand\nMouseY()\n.\n\n\nThe reason for the\n()\nor box after\nMouseY\nis that\nMouseY()\nis a procedure call even though it doesn’t take any inputs.\n\n\n\nThe script  would be written as\n\nREPEAT UNTIL(mouseY() < 0)\n{\nDISPLAY(numFish)\n}\n\nor \n\n\nRemember, you don’t need to learn to write the made-up language used on the AP exam. You just have to be able to read and answer questions about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your program a few times.\n\n\n\n\nRight now, when the sprites meet, they just stop. Make them have a conversation when they stop. You can do that by adding code like this to Leader’s script. Make up your own conversation. You can use any language you can type. Here’s an example using several languages.\n\n\nLeader does things itself. It also tells Follower what to do and when to do it. This code puts Leader in charge of Follower.\n\n\n\nCRD-2.B.2, AAP-2.B.2, AAP-2.B.6\n\n\nA code segment is a sequence of connected instructions that carry out a purposeful action, such as the one pictured on the left, which animates a conversation. The instructions in the code segment are carried out in order, from top to bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent the two sprites from being stuck to each other unable to move, the sprites will need some space between them and some time apart before the chase starts. Blocks such as these may help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the sprites costumes.\n\nYou can use a picture from the Internet by dragging the picture into the Snap! window.\n\n\n\nChange the background on the stage.\n\nThere are instructions in the If There Is Time section on Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 3: Customizing and Debugging."

    "text": "In this lab, you will use local and global variables to store information. \n\n\nOn this page, you will begin to develop a number guessing game that uses a local variable to keep track of a secret number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“U2L1-NumberGuessing”\n\n\n\nStart building a new command block called number guessing game that will contain the code for the game. Leave the Block Editor open.\n\n\n\n\nIn a number-guessing game, the player tries to guess the computer’s secret number. The computer needs a way to store the secret number in a variable so that it can compare it to the player’s guesses. \n\n\n: Variable\n\nAAP-1.A.1\n\n\nA variable is like a labeled box that can hold one value at a time, such as one word, one costume, or one list (which can contain many things). You can look at what’s inside as many times as you want.\n\n\nOn Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk, you learned about procedural abstraction: giving scripts names by putting them in new blocks. Here, we are starting to look at data abstraction, giving names to numbers, text, lists, etc. When you give something a name, you can refer to it without knowing exactly what the value is.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a script variable called secret number to store the number that the player will try to guess (instructions below).\n\n\nMaking a Script Variable\n\n\n\nMove a script variables block into the Scripting Area. You can find it in the Variables palette. \n\n\nName the variable by clicking on the orange a at the end and typing the name you want. Here, it should be called secret number.\n\n\nLater, you will use the script variable by dragging it out of the script variables block (the way you drag an input) and placing it where you need it in your code.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-1.A, AAP-3.E\n\nUse  to set the initial value of secret number to a random number from 1 to 10. The set menu lets you select which variable to set. \n\nThe variable secret number is available in the set block only when you snap it somewhere after the script variables block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-1.B.2\n\n\n would be written as\nsecretNumber ← 7\nor .\n\n\n\nScript variables are a kind of local variable; they work only within the script where they’re created. If you drag one into a different script, it won’t work. You’ve seen two kinds of local variables before: inputs to blocks and for counters.\n\n\n\nExamples you’ve seen before.\n\n\n\nYou have created variables as inputs to blocks that you made: \n\n\nYou have used the counter variable that the for block gave you: \n\n\n\n\n: Local Variable\n\nA local variable can be set or used only in the environment in which it is defined. This term includes inputs to procedures and variables created by the for or script variables block.\n\n\n\n\nIn algebra, a variable is sometimes used for something whose value you don’t know yet, and the goal is to find out its value. In programming you decide the values of variables.\n\n\n\nAAP-1.A.1\n\n\nYou learned about input variables on Unit 1 Lab 3 Page 3: Blocks with Inputs.\n\n\nWhen you assign a value to a variable, the variable holds that value, not where it came from. For example, if apples = 2 and you , then bananas will hold the value 2 and have no memory of it having come from apples. This is why\na ← a * 2\nmeans something. (Suppose a = 8. First compute the value of\na * 2\n, namely 16, and then replace the old value of a with 16). Up to now, the only variables you’ve used are input variables, and you never assign a value to an input because the value is given by the code that calls it. But a script variable won’t have a value until you give it one with set.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-1.B, AAP-1.B.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples like this one are useful to test your understanding of assignment to variables, but you wouldn’t use a sequence of assignments like this in an actual program.\n\nWhat value will this code display?\na ← 3\nb ← a\na ← 4\nDISPLAY(b)\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nCorrect! The variable b is assigned the value of the variable a (which is 3 when\nb ← a\nis done).\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nThe variable b is given the value of the variable a (which is 3 when\nb ← a\nis done); b doesn’t remember that the 3 came from a so it doesn’t change when a is changed.\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nThe variable b has been set to the value of the variable a, not the letter “a” itself.\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\nThe script will display the value of the variable b, not the letter “b” itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat value will this script report? \n\n\n\n-5\n\n\nCorrect!\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe value of the variable m is always greater than the value of the variable k in this script, so subtracting m from k will give a negative number.\n\n\n\n\n-4\n\n\nThe value of the variable m is 9 at the beginning, but it has been changed by the time it is subtracted from k.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nThe last set command sets the value of the variable k to the value k – m, not m – k."

    "text": "On this page, you’ll continue to develop your number guessing game to accept player guesses until the player guesses correctly.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll want the computer to ask players to guess again and again until they guess correctly. To do that, you will use the  block. Repeat until is a loop (just like repeat, forever, and for) but also a conditional (like if and if else). It repeats until a certain condition is met. For this program, the code should repeat until the player’s answer equals the secret number.\n\n\n\nYou learned about loops on Unit 1 Lab 3 Page 6: Looping with a Counter.\n\n\nYou’ve seen conditionals on Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 5: Adding Variety to Gossip and Unit 1 Lab 5 Page 2: Sprite Following a Sprite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse repeat until to ask the player () to guess the secret number until their  equals the secret number.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the secret number variable out of the script variables block to use it.\n\n\nThe ask and answer blocks go together. If you use ask to ask a question, the user’s answer will be reported by answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code  would be written as\n\nDISPLAY(\"Why did the chicken cross the road?\")\nuserResponse ← INPUT()\n\nor .\n\n\nAAP-3.A.8, AAP-3.A.9\n\n\nNotice that the procedure\nINPUT()\naccepts the value from the user and returns that input value, which is then assigned to the variable\nuserResponse\nwith the\n←\nsyntax. In Snap!, this is just like how answer accepts a value from the user and reports it, and that report is what the computer sets the variable user response to.\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.B\n\n\nAfter the player guesses the secret number, make the computer congratulate the player.\n\n\nTest and debug. Take turns playing the game, and fix any problems with the code before moving on.\n\n\n\n\nRepeat until makes its decision based on the output of a hexagonal predicate block.\n\n\n: Predicate and Boolean value\n\n  Why is Boolean capitalized? \n\n\nThe word Boolean is capitalized because it’s named after a person, George Boole, who invented the branch of mathematics dealing with Boolean operations (such as and, or, and not).\n\n\n\n\nA predicate is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples: 7 reporting true” title=“8 > 7 reporting true” /> 7 reporting false” title=“6 > 7 reporting false” />\n\n\nAAP-2.E.1\n\n\nPredicates report a Boolean value (either  or ).\n\n\n\nPredicates fit into a hexagonal input slots of conditionals, such as in  and . Predicates help conditionals decide when to do something.\n\n\n\nThe if and if-else blocks are called conditionals because they control the code based on a true-or-false condition.\n\n\nClick for examples of predicates being used inside conditionals.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe really shouldn’t be encouraging students to mutate a block’s inputs. There are really two issues here; one is with the x=x+1 style of programming altogether, and the second is that formal parameters specifically shouldn’t generally be mutated; it’s better to make a script variable that’s initialized to the input value. (If we change this, we need to update the Guided Notes.) –MF, 6/26/21 with BH\n\n Which inputs to mystery function will report “finished”?\n\n\n\nAny integer\n\n\nCorrect!

(This doesn’t necessarily happen in every procedure, but here it will.)\n\n\n\n\nOnly integers greater than or equal to 5\n\n\nWrite out some examples of what happens when the input is less than 5. For example, if the input is 3, the sprite will say 3, the input will be changed to 4, the sprite will say 4, the input will be changed to 5, the repeat until loop will stop, and the function will report “finished.”\n\n\n\n\nOnly integers less than 5\n\n\nThe report command isn’t inside the if.\n\n\n\n\nOnly 5\n\n\nThe repeat until block checks the value of input every time through the loop, not just its initial value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What will the sprite say if you run the same function with the input 1?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt does say 4 at the end, but it says other things before that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does repeat until work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect! The repeat until block runs the code in its script slot until input = 5, then the computer skips down to the next command, report (finished), without the sprite ever saying 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe repeat until block tests the value of input before running the code in its script slot.\n\n\n\nThe feedback is not finished because I realized that BH might object to changing the value of an input variable… –MF, 3/1/19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What will happen if you run the same function with the input 9?\n\n\n\nThe sprite will say 9, and the block will report “finished.”\n\n\nWhat does the if block do when input is 9?\n\n\n\n\nThe sprite will say 9, 8, 7, 6, and the block will report “finished.”\n\n\nWhat does the set instruction do to the value of input?\n\n\n\n\nThe sprite will say 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, … and keep counting, and the block will never report “finished.”\n\n\nWhen input is 9, will the code inside the if command run?\n\n\n\n\nThe sprite will say nothing, and the block will report “finished.”\n\n\nCorrect! The code inside the if command will not run.\n\n\n\nThe feedback is not finished because I realized that BH might object to changing the value of an input variable… –MF, 3/1/19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the computer congratulates the player for guessing correctly, have the computer say the number. For example, it might say, “You guessed it! My secret number was 7.”\n\n\n\nUse join to merge the text “You guessed it! My secret number was” with the value of the secret number variable."

It has a bug—an error in the code that makes the program behave differently than expected. This code, if you keep playing over and over, will mostly work, but sometimes (not often) it will congratulate you before you even guess.\n\n Analyze the code, explain how this can happen, fix the bug, and save the project.\n\n\n\n\nHave it pick its random number just from 1 to 3 to make the bug occur more often.\n\n\nIf you want to add more script variables, use the right-pointing triangle.

When the game is played again, the program will create a new secret number variable and give it a new random number.\n\n\n\nIn a later unit, you will teach the computer how to guess a secret number that you have chosen.\n\n\n\n\nRight now, the script always picks a number between 1 and 10. At the start of the game, ask the player what the maximum number should be, and make your program choose a number between 1 and maximum.\n\n\nUse another script variable to keep track of how many guesses the player makes before getting the right number. When the player guesses the secret number, say how many guesses it took.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind a way to vary the language a bit so that your program does not always repeat exactly the same words in the same situation. For example, if a player guesses too high twice in a row, the program could say “That’s still too big. Try another number.”"

But if multiple scripts need access to a variable or if the information in that variable needs to be saved with your project, then use a global variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project, play the game, and review the code so you remember how it works.\n\n\n\n“U2L1-ClickAlonzo” Be sure to rename your project with “U2” in the filename.\n\n\n\nIf you save new work under an old filename, Snap! will overwrite your original project.

This is done differently for local and global variables:\n\n\nGlobal variables have check-boxes that control the display of the variable watcher on the stage (shown below). \n\n\nIf it’s a local (script) variable, you can use the show variable block inside the script to display a watcher on the stage (and use hide variable to hide it again).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the sprite moves without being clicked, make the score go down by 1.\n\n\nGame too hard? Increase the score by 2 for a hit. Too big a change? Increase by 3 for a hit, decrease by 2 for a miss. You can make arbitrarily fine adjustments. This process is called playtuning a game."

Each element has a unique index (position) in the list.\n\n\nYou can use the  or  block to add elements to a list.\n\n\nInsert puts the new item before the place you specify.\n\n\nAdd puts the item after the last existing item.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-1.D.6\n\n\nAssigning a list to a variable lets you use one name to represent all the elements of a list as a unit.\n\n\n\nAAP-2.N.1 bullet 4\n\n\n would be written as\nINSERT(shoppingList, 2, \"tomatoes\")\nor .\n\n\nAAP-2.N.1 bullet 5\n\n\n would be written as\nAPPEND(shoppingList, \"tomatoes\")\nor .\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.N part a\n\n\n\nYou’ve seen the ask and answer blocks on Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 2: Checking the Player’s Guess.\n\n\nYou’ve worked with multiple sprites on Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk.\n\n\n\nWrite a script for the “Add Item” button sprite so that when that sprite is clicked, it will ask the user for a new item, and then put the user’s answer in the grocery list.\n\n\nTest your “Add Item” button several times and fix any problems.\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Items from a List\n\n\n\n\nWrite a script for the “Clear List” button sprite that asks the user if they’re sure and then sets shopping list back to an empty list.\n\n\nTest your “Clear List” button and fix it if needed.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also remove items from a list using . The delete block takes an item number and a list as input and it removes the item at that position from the list.\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.N.1 bullet 6\n\n would be written as\nREMOVE(shoppingList, 2)\nor .\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a script for the “Delete Item” button sprite so that when that sprite is clicked, it will ask the user to “Enter the number of the grocery item you wish to delete,” and then remove the item with that number from the grocery list.\n\n\nTest your “Delete Item” button.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe items in a list are values, so you can use item of anywhere you can use any other expression. For example:\n\n\nAAP-2.N.1 bullets 2 and 3\n\n\nYou can assign a list item to a variable. On the exam…\n\n\n\n would be written as\nmyFavoriteFood ← shoppingList[3]\nor \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can assign any value to a list item (a number, a string, a sprite, a costume, a script, another list, etc.). On the exam…\n\n\n\n would be written as\nshoppingList[2] ← yourFavoriteFood\nor .\n\n\n would be written as\nshoppingList[1] ← shoppingList[3]\nor .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run this script in Snap!, the second line of code assigns to shopping list 2 the value of shopping list (that is, the same list, not a copy). So, the third line of code modifies both variables:   \n\n\nAAP-1.D.7 bullet 3, AAP-2.N.2\n\n\nHowever on the exam, the statement\nshoppingList2 ← shoppingList\nmakes a copy of the list. So modifying one of them does not modify the other.\n\n\nThe rules for how to use lists and how they behave differ depending on the programming language you are using."

    "text": "On this page, you will begin to develop a quiz app by creating an abstract data type to pair the questions with their answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide what type of quiz you would like to build, and write three to five questions and their correct answers.\n\n\nRead the following section. (Don’t build these in Snap!. You’ll build your own quiz later on the page.)\n\n\n\n\n\n: Sublist\n\nA sublist is a list used as an item of another list.\n\n\n(The word sublist is also used to refer to some subset of a list.)\n\n\nYou’ll use a list to store your quiz items in a global variable and use a sublist for each question/answer pair. Then you can choose just one pair at a time to work with.  \n\n\nAAP.1.D.2, AAP.1.D.3, AAP.1.D.4\n\n\nBut code like  is hard to read and understand. A better way is to use abstraction to organize the quiz items. The abstraction just hides the list and item of blocks, so it isn’t complicated to build, but it can make your code much easier to write, read, and debug.  \n\n\n: Data Types\n\n\nA data type is what kind of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, number is the data type for the first input to  and list is the the data type for its second input.\n\n\nAAP-1.A.3 second sentence\n\n\nEach programming language provides some primitive data types (data types that are built-in). For example, Snap! provides numbers, text (words and sentences), Booleans (true or false), lists, and some you haven’t yet used as data (such as sprites and costumes). This menu shows all of Snap!’s primitive types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: Abstract Data Types\n\n\nAAP.1.D.1\n\n\n\nThe word “abstract” is often used casually to mean something harder to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program easier for you and others to read, debug, and improve.\n\n\n\nAn abstract data type (ADT) is a custom data type that’s meaningful to your program. It’s not built into the language; you develop it as you code. This is an abstraction because it hides the details inside the constructor and selectors so that the programmer who uses a quiz item has to think only about questions and answers, not about list indices.\n\n\nThe  block is the constructor; it constructs one example of the data structure. By naming the pieces of the structure, the constructor makes it certain that every time you use it, you build the structure in the right order. \n\n\nThe  and  blocks are the selectors; they each select one piece of the data structure. \n\n\nThe constructor and selector together implement the quiz item abstract data type.\n\n\nDAT-1.A.5\n\n\nData abstraction is the creation and use of abstract data types in a program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“U2L2-Quiz” \n\n\n\nAAP-1.D\n\n\nBuild the custom quiz item abstract data type (both the constructor and the two selectors).\n\n\n\nSpecifying an Input Type\n\n\nYour selectors expect a quiz item, i.e., a list, as input. You can make your blocks show what type of data they expect. It’s not necessary in Snap! but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You’ve already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types.\n\n\nIn the Block Editor while creating a selector, click on a plus sign to enter an input name. Then…\n\n\nClick on the arrow to the right of the input name: \n\n\nChoose the data type you want for that input. (For this project, you’ll use the “text” and “list” input types.)\n\n\nClick “OK.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a global variable to store your quiz items and initialize it as a list of items, using your constructor where appropriate.\n\n                  <a id=\"two-views\">\n \n\nSnap! has two different views for lists within lists. You can switch which view you see by right-clicking (or control-clicking) on the quiz watcher (or whatever you called the variable) on the stage.\n\nIf you don’t see the watcher on the stage, make sure the checkbox beside the quiz variable in the Variables palette is checked. \n\n\n\nTable View for computer science quiz Watcher (your quiz will be different): \n\nMy watcher is too narrow.\n\nAt first the watcher will look like this:  Drag out the resize handle at the lower right to get this:  Then hover your mouse over the letter A near the top. It will turn into a digit 1. Grab it and drag it to the right: \n\n\n\n\nList View for computer science quiz Watcher: \n\n\n\n\n: Table\n\nA table is a two-dimensional data structure with rows and columns. If you’ve used a spreadsheet program, what it displays is a table.\n\n\nIn Snap!, a table is implemented as a list of lists, in which each sublist is one row of the table.\n\n\n\n\nTest both the selectors for different items in your list of quiz items, and debug any problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine you make a variable capitals and use set to give this list of lists a name:   Which of the following statements are true?  Choose all that apply.\n\n\n\n\n reports a list with two items: “Augusta” and “Maine”.\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\n\n\n reports the word “Augusta”.\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\n\n\n reports the word “Iowa”.\n\n\nNo. What is item 2 of “capitals”?\n\n\n\n\n reports the number 8.\n\n\nNo. Each of the small lists is a single item in the list “capitals” .\n\n\n\n\n reports a list with one item: “Iowa”.\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\n\n\n reports the string “Boise”.\n\n\nThe items of capitals are lists.\n\n\n\n\n reports the string “Iowa”.\n\n\nThe items of all but first of (capitals) are lists.\n\n\n\n\n reports the number 2.\n\n\nCorrect."

Is is everywhere else. –MF, 5/30/20\n\n\nIf it’s not already open, open your project U2L2-Quiz.\n\n\n \n\nThe students are considering how to use their abstract data type as they develop the code for their project.\n\n\nAlphie: We can use our  and  selectors to get the question and answer for quiz item in our list. But how do we get the quiz item out of the list in the first place?\n\n\nGamal: Maybe we can use item of inside a for loop and use the index from the for loop as the first input to item of, like this: \n\n\n\nUsing the result from item as the input to address from contact is called composition of functions.\n\n\n\nBetsy: Yeah, we could, but that’s a little hard to read with that index variable, i, to keep track of. And if we add more questions, we’ll have to update that number 4 that tells us when to end the loop. I bet we can use for each to traverse the list.\n\n\nBetsy drags for each into the scripting area. \n\n\nGamal: We could even rename item something logical like quiz item. Then the code inside will run once for each quiz item in our list.\n\n\n\n: Traversing a List\n\nAAP-2.O.2\n\n\nTraversing a list means looking at each item of the list. For each is iterative. That is, it’s repetitive, like for, which can also traverse a list. But unlike for, for each traverses the list without using index numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.K part a, AAP-2.O part a\n\n\nUse for each to traverse your list, asking each quiz question, checking each answer, and letting the user know if they are right or wrong on each item.\n\n\nTake your quiz a few times as a user would, and work out any problems with the code. Then, give your quiz to a friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the user is wrong, don’t just let them know, but tell them the right answer too.\n\n\nUse a script variable to keep track of the player’s score and report it at the end of the quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.K part b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the scripts below will produce the following sprite behavior?  (When you run the script, though, it actually says Abraham Lincoln only once.)\n\n\nChoose all that apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, when a sprite says a list, we see a visual representation of the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, this says “Abraham Lincoln” all at once, not in two separate speech balloons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.O.3\n\n\n\nThe procedure\ngoto()\nisn’t built in to the AP’s language so it is written in lower case like other programmer-defined procedures.\n\nThe script  would be written as\n\nFOR EACH point IN myDrawing\n{\ngoto(point)\n}\n\nor .\n\n\n\n\nThese questions are similar to those you will see on the AP CSP exam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAP-2.O part b\n\ninputList ← [3, -1, 2, 10, -5]\n\nFOR EACH item IN inputList\n{   \nIF(item > 0  AND  item * item > 4)\n{\nDISPLAY(item)\n}\n}\n\n What will be displayed as a result of running the code segment given?\n\n\n\n9, 1, 4, 100, 25\n\n\nWhat does the\nIF\ninstruction test?

For example, someone might answer “What kind of variable is available only in the part of the program where it is defined?” with “a local variable,” “local variable,” or just “local,” or the same possibilities for “script variable.” So your question answer ADT could take a list of keywords in the second slot and accept any answer that includes any of the keywords (so in this case, the list would be {local, script} and would accept “a local one”).

So the only operations that can be performed at that lowest level are those that <em>operate on single-bit values</em> (just ones and zeros, that is, just ons and offs). These are called <em>logical (or Boolean) functions</em>. (They're predicates, because their range is Booleans, but these are special in that their <em>domain</em> is also Booleans.) There are three Boolean functions in the Operators palette:<br />\n        <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/prog/Booleans.png\" alt=\"and, or, not blocks\" title=\"and, or, not blocks\" /><br />\n        <div class=\"comment\">AAP-2.F.5, AAP-2.F.1</div>\n        Notice that both the blocks themselves and the input slots in the blocks are hexagonal. Boolean functions take Boolean values (<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>) as inputs and report a new Boolean value as output.

What are the four letters for the <code>and</code> function? (Assume the same ordering of the inputs: TT, TF, FT, and FF as shown above with <code>or</code>.) </li>\n                    <li>\n                        Make up another set of four letters (such as TFTF), and build a predicate function with that behavior.

The <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/blocks/keep.png\" alt=\"keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'\" title=\"keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'\" /> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the input list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>\n    \n    <p>\n        For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>\n        <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png\" alt=\"keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)\" title=\"keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)\">\n    </p>\n    \n    <div class=\"vocabFullWidth\">: <strong>String</strong> and <strong>Index</strong>\n        <ul>\n            <div class=\"comment\">AAP-1.C.4</div>\n            <li>A <strong>string</strong> is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>\n            <div class=\"comment\">AAP-1.C.3 (strings)</div>\n            <li><a href=\"/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-quizzes.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment\" title=\"You've already learned the word index\">You've already learned</a> the word <strong>index</strong> for the position of an element in a list.

For example, <img src=\"/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png\" alt=\"(17) mod (5)\" title=\"(17) mod (5)\" /> reports 2 because when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. When one number divides another evenly, the remainder is 0. So for example, <img src=\"/img/1-introduction/15-mod-5.png\" alt=\"(15) mod (5)\" title=\"(15) mod (5)\" /> reports 0.</div>\n    <div class=\"examFullWidth\">\n        <div class=\"pseudop\">\n            <div class=\"sidenote\">Different programming languages have different ways of handling negative inputs to the mod function. So you won't see any negative numbers used with mod on the exam.</div>\n            <strong>The <code>mod</code> operator:</strong> The expression <img class=\"inline nopadtb\" src=\"/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png\" alt=\"(17) mod (5)\" title=\"(17) mod (5)\" /> would be written as <pre class=\"inline\">17 MOD 5</pre> on the exam. If you see an expression with variables as input to <code>mod</code>, such as <pre class=\"inline\">a MOD b</pre>, you can assume that <var>a</var> is zero or positive, and <var>b</var> is strictly positive (because you can't divide by 0).\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"comment\">AAP-2.B.5, AAP-2.C.1, AAP-2.C.2, AAP-2.C.3, AAP-2.C.4</div>\n        <div class=\"pseudop\">On the exam, you may see these four arithmetic operators: <pre class=\"inline\">+</pre>,  <pre class=\"inline\">-</pre>,  <pre class=\"inline\">*</pre>, <pre class=\"inline\">/</pre> (plus, minus, times, divide) as well as <pre class=\"inline\">MOD</pre>. Arithmetic operators are part of most programming languages.  (Most text languages use <pre class=\"inline\">*</pre> rather than <pre class=\"inline\">&times;</pre> for multiplication because <pre class=\"inline\">&times</pre> isn't on most keyboards, and because it looks too much like the letter x.)</div>\n        <div class=\"comment\">AAP-2.L.2</div>\n        <div class=\"pseudop\"><strong>Order of operations:</strong> In a block language, the nesting of blocks determines the order of operations.  For example, in <img class=\"inline nopadtb\" src=\"/img/6-computers/3-times(5+4).png\" alt=\"3 × (5 + 4)\" title=\"3 × (5 + 4)\" /> you can <em>see</em> that the <code>+</code> block is an input to the <code>&times;</code> block, so the expression means 3&times;(5+4). Similarly, <img class=\"inline nopadtb\" src=\"/img/6-computers/(3-times-5)+4.png\" alt=\"(3 × 5) + 4\" title=\"(3 × 5) + 4\" />  means (3&times;5)+4. In Snap<em>!</em>, it's as if there are parentheses around <em>every</em> operation.  But in text languages, you can write <pre class=\"inline\">3 * 4 + 5</pre> \n        without parentheses, so they need the rules you learn in math class (multiplication before addition, and so on). The <code>mod</code> operator is like multiplication and division; it happens <em>before</em> addition and subtraction. So for example, <pre class=\"inline\">7 + 5 MOD 2 - 6</pre> means <pre class=\"inline\">7 + 1 - 6</pre>, which is, of course, 2.</div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"forYouToDo\">\n        <ol start=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"sidenote\">                    \n                In a later lab, you can use your <code>even?</code> block to draw a <a href=\"/cur/programming/3-lists/1-abstraction/4-brick-wall.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment\" title=\"Brick Wall\">brick wall</a> because the even and odd numbered rows are different. <br />\n                <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/wall.png\" alt=\"Sample image of brick wall\" title=\"Sample image of brick wall\" />\n            </div>\n            <li>\n                Use <code>mod</code> to build a <img class=\"nopadtb\" src=\"/img/2-complexity/divisible-by.png\" alt=\"is () divisible by () ?\" title=\"is () divisible by () ?\" /> predicate that tests for divisibility.<br />\n                <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/2-complexity/15-divisible-by-3-reporting-true.png\" alt=\"is (15) divisible by (3) ? reporting true\" title=\"is (15) divisible by (3) ? reporting true\" />\n                <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/2-complexity/15-divisible-by-6-reporting-false.png\" alt=\"is (15) divisible by (6) ? reporting false\" title=\"is (15) divisible by (6) ? reporting false\" />\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                Use this <code>divisible by?</code> predicate to build a predicate that tests whether its input is even (divisible by 2).<br />\n                <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/2-complexity/even--22-reporting-true.png\" alt=\"even?

The Randall novel tells the story from the point of view of one of Scarlett's slaves, Cynara.  Mitchell's estate sued Randall and her publisher for copyright violation, but Randall claimed fair use under the parody rule.

In the case of homes, an owner can pass the right of ownership on to her children, grandchildren, and so on forever.  But copyrights and patents are in force only for a limited time.</p>\n    <p>Over the past 50 years or so, Congress has repeatedly extended the duration of copyrights. Critics note that each of these extensions has come just as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie#Copyright_status\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Steamboat Willie\">the first Mickey Mouse cartoon</a> was about to pass out of copyright. Although all concerned say this is a coincidence, the Disney company has become a sort of poster child for abuse of copyrights.  Ironically, many of the Disney cartoons (Snow White, Cinderella, etc.) are based on stories that are in the public domain (okay for anyone to use), but would still be under copyright if today's copyright law had been in effect when earlier versions were written.</p>\n    <p>Why did the writers of the Constitution include provisions for copyrights (and patents)? What they had in mind was not an absolute property right, but rather a <em>bargain</em> in which society lets authors and inventors make a lot of money from their ideas, but in return those ideas must eventually belong to the entire society, free for anyone to use.</p>\n\n\n        <p>When someone has a birthday party at a restaurant, it's very common that when they bring out the birthday cake, all the waiters gather around the table and sing \"Happy Birthday.\" But until quite recently, they did so <em>illegally</em>; there is a copyright currently owned by Warner/Chappell Music, based on the original authorship of a song with the same melody but different lyrics by sisters Patty and Mildred Hill in 1893 (more than a century ago). A 2015 court decision has invalidated the copyright, but it may be appealed by Warner, which had been collecting about $2 million per year in fees charged for permission to use the song, especially in films.</p>\n    </div>"

Many digital media are distributed in encrypted form. Buyers can't play the media without the software that decrypts them, and the software will only do so if certain conditions designed by the publisher are met. Maybe a file can only be played on a particular computer. Maybe there can't be two copies with the same serial number. Maybe the file times out on a particular date and can never be used again.</p>\n    <p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) software is a big change in the social contract. The whole idea of copyright is that eventually it expires and the work is in the public domain, freely copyable by anyone. But DRM allows publishers to have it both ways: they get copyright protection during the time when a work is most popular, <em>and</em> DRM gives them control over the content forever.</p>\n    \n    <h2>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h2>\n    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a US law that went into effect in 1998. It makes it a crime to figure out how to defeat DRM systems, whether or not a copyright is actually violated. It protects Internet service providers and website operators from third-party copyright violation penalties (for example, if you post a copyrighted video on YouTube, YouTube is not liable) provided that the operator (YouTube) removes the infringing material as soon as it is notified of the violation. If the original poster thinks the material does not violate a copyright, the burden is on them to prove it.</p>\n    <div class=\"endnote\">\n        <a href=\"#hint-exemptions\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" title=\"Are there any exemptions to DMCA?\">Are there any exemptions?</a>\n        <div id=\"hint-exemptions\" class=\"collapse\">Temporary exemptions to the anti-circumvention part of the DMCA can be made by the Librarian of Congress for a three-year period (a surprising choice, since the Library of Congress previously wasn't involved in judging copyright issues), but any such exemption must be renewed by the Librarian every three years. Most such exemptions are made for technical reasons (e.g., to allow one piece of equipment to work with another piece of equipment from a different manufacturer), but there was great excitement in 2010 when the Librarian of Congress allowed people to jailbreak their cell phones.</div>\n    </div>\n    <p>\n        Here two examples of manufacturers using the DMCA in creative ways, possibly not for purposes envisioned in the original copyright provisions.\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Printer Ink Cartridges:</strong> Printer manufacturers don't make much money when you buy a printer; competition drives prices down. Instead, they make profits when you buy replacement ink cartridges because you have to buy ones that fit the printer. Lexmark, a printer manufacturer, developed a technology by which printers would not use cartridges unless they provided a Lexmark digital signature. Another company reverse-engineered the cartridge and created their own cartridges that would work with Lexmark's printers. Lexmark sued under the DMCA, claiming a copyright violation because the other company copied the tiny program that provided the signature. Ultimately Lexmark lost; what they did was determined not to be a legitimate use of the DMCA.</li>\n            <li><strong>DVD Region Codes:</strong> The fine print on the back of a DVD case often says something like \"this DVD is licensed for sale in North America.\" This restriction is enforced by DRM. Your DVD player knows what region of the world it's in. The purpose of this system is to allow film companies to sell DVDs cheaply in poor countries but charge more in rich countries. (Without region coding, people would import DVDs from the poor countries and resell them here. Region coding can also be used to allow different versions of a film to account for different censorship rules.) This system is protected by the DMCA.</li>\n            <div class=\"endnote\">\n                <a href=\"#hint-free-trade\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" title=\"Doesn't DVD region coding violate free-trade?\">Doesn't this violate free-trade?</a>\n                <div id=\"hint-free-trade\" class=\"collapse\">Arguments have been made that region coding violates free-trade treaties that forbid most restrictions on exporting goods from one country to another. It would definitely be a treaty violation if the US government had invented region coding, but since it's a creation of private companies, the question has not been settled. But the DMCA law can be seen as though the government is enforcing the region coding, so some people argue that it is a treaty violation.</div>\n            </div>\n        </ul>\n    </p>\n            \n    <div class=\"forYouToDo\" id=\"first\">\n        <ol>\n            <li>People in poor countries have more limited access to technology than people in rich countries. Look up the \"Digital Divide\" to find out about this problem. Do you think DVD (and Blu-Ray, by the way) region coding contributes to the digital divide?</li>\n        </ol>\n    </div>\n    \n</body>"

In English, the plurals of some nouns add  \"s\";  some add \"es\"; nouns like \"calf\" and \"fly\" become \"calves\" and \"flies\", changing their final letters before adding \"es\". And more. For a programming task this complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the \"top-level\" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—use those specialists. That is, instead of coding every little detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to make <code>plural</code> look something like this.<br />\n                    <img class=\"indent noshadow\" src=\"/img/2-complexity/plural-abstract-definition.png\" alt=\"abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s\" title=\"abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s\"></p>\n                <p>Showing<a name=\"abstraction\" class=\"anchor\">&nbsp;</a>the <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the \"top-level\" block and leaving the details to  separate blocks is one part of an important computer science idea called <em>abstraction</em>.

Isolate some details into a custom block, and get that working right. Then use that abstraction just as if it were built into Snap<em>!</em>. Abstraction allows you to build and test pieces of your code one at a time; it makes your code more readable.

That may sound obvious, but in fact, beginning programmers make mistakes like that all the time; you have to teach yourself to think about the input  and output types of your functions every time you write or use one. </p>\n                    <p>That's also true about the inputs to the <code>contact</code> constructor; you can't put something that isn't a name in the name input for <code>contact</code>.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"endnote\">\n                    <p>\n                        It's somewhat artificial to use the constructor as the input to a selector; these images are just examples to show what the selectors should be able to do when given a contact as input.

This project is different: Nothing happens until you click a button (recall from Unit 1 that this is called an <em>event</em>), which starts a script that just runs briefly, to do whatever action the button requires.  This kind of program structure is called <strong>event-driven</strong> programming.</div>\n    <div class=\"ifTime\">\n        <ol start=\"4\">\n            <li>The sprites' questions might be covered up by the <var>contact list</var> watcher on the stage.

When you look up a particular person, you want to see their name as you've been seeing it on this page, first name first: \"Alphie Preston.\"  But suppose you want to <em>sort</em> your contacts.  Typically that's done by <em>last</em> name, so the list would look something like\n            <ul>\n                <li>Abdel, Gamal</li>\n                <li>Anderson, Betsy</li>\n                <li>Preston, Alphie</li>\n            </ul>\n            So you need to be able to show a name first name first for ordinary display, but last name first for sorting.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>Before you begin,</strong> save your project again, under the name U3L2-TIF.  This will keep your work on these problems separate from the regular problems.\n        </p>\n\n        <ol type=\"A\">\n            <li>The first step is to <strong>create an abstract data\n            type</strong> for names.  You'll need a constructor that takes first name and last name as inputs, and reports a list of them to represent the name part of a contact.</li>\n            <li><strong>Reading a name:</strong> The next step is to modify the program you wrote above so that it asks separately for the first name and the last name, constructs a name (that is, a list) using the constructor you just wrote, and uses that list as the name input to the <code>contact with name</code> block.  This is an abstract data type (name) inside another abstract data type (contact).</li>\n            <li><strong>Writing a name:</strong> Your <code>name from contact</code> block will now report a list, as it should.  But some other parts of the program, such as the part that displays a contact to the user, want to display the name as a text string: \"Betsy Anderson.\"  The part that sorts the contact list also wants a string: \"Anderson, Betsy.\"  Write two blocks <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/3-lists/name-display-form-from-contact.png\" alt=\"name, display form, from contact 'list input slot\" title=\"name, display form, from contact 'list input slot\" /> and <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/3-lists/name-sort-form-from-contact.png\" alt=\"name, sort form, from contact 'list input slot\" title=\"name, sort form, from contact 'list input slot\" /> that join the two parts of the name with a space and/or a comma as needed.</li>\n        </ol>\n        <div class=\"takeNote\">This three-step process (create an ADT, use it to read values of that type, use it to write values of that type) is very common in programming.  You'll follow the same three steps again in the Take It Further on page 4.</div>\n        <p><strong>Save your work.</strong>  On page 4 you're going to find a contact by letting the user enter any part of the name, and display the entire contact.  Use the name abstraction you've just created when you do that.</p>\n    </div>\n    \n</body>"

Most people in the United States say their given name (the one their parents chose for them) first, and their family name last.  But in China, for example, the family name comes first.

The first will be either the text 'given-first' or 'family-first'.  This first item is called a <em>type tag.</em>  The second item will be the given name (or names), and the third will be the family name (or names).\n                <div class=\"endnote\">\n                    You've been using type tags all along without knowing it. Many programming languages, including Snap<i>!</i>, attach type tags to every value, saying \"I am a list\" or \"I am a number\" and so on.  The user (i.e., you) doesn't see the type tags, unless you provide a bad input to a primitive block, and you see a message like \"Expecting list but getting text.\"\n                </div>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png\" alt=\"Tough Stuff\" title=\"Tough Stuff\" />\n                <strong>Reading a name:</strong> Find where you ask the user for first and last name, and change the code to ask for given name(s) and family name.

There are new jobs available, but they’re not as good as the old ones; they are some or all of part-time, low-pay, short-term, or without benefits such as health insurance."

Companies often outsource certain tasks to other companies that may (sometimes) be in other countries where people are  paid less. Technology has made outsourcing easier. But technology companies often outsource things like janitorial services, in part so they can say things like &quot;All our employees have excellent health benefits.&quot; (... But the janitors aren't employees, so they don't count.)</p>\n                        <div class=\"endnote\">How can it cost less to pay another company to pay a janitor for you, so you are paying both the janitor and the boss of the janitorial company, than to pay the janitor directly?  The answer is that the janitorial company pays very low wages.  Often they hire undocumented workers, who can't complain to authorities without risking deportation.  This is another reason the technology companies like to outsource low-paying jobs:  It's illegal to hire undocumented workers, but if you pay a janitorial company instead, you're not hiring workers directly and it's not your obligation to check on their eligibility for employment.</div>\n                        <p>Sometimes individuals, not just companies,  outsource parts of their lives. Search for articles  to read about <strong>personal outsourcing</strong> companies and people who use them.

I like the idea of turtlifying it, though only the hint directs students away from a turtle solution. Using the method of locating the points by algorithm, storing them, then using that list of coordinates will be simpler than pure turtle, possibly even for the cardioid and other such envelopes inside a circle). I'd be inclined to have it start with just the animated image, and another one, a bit slower, animating the cardioid development in a circle (one end moves a step at a time, the other end two steps for cardioid), letting kids figure out what generating rule is involved. It's just personal taste, but I find \"With your partner discuss\" to be such a lame schoolish Micky Mouse instruction—no real setting tells us to discuss with our partner. And what business, in an optional project do we have saying \"develop an algorithm and then use abstraction\"?  What sense does it make for us to say how to do what students don't have to do at all?

It works because it's engineered to be fault-tolerant (capable of working even if some of the network breaks down) and uses protocols (a type of abstraction) for routing and transmitting data:\n        <ul>\n            <li>The Internet is fault-tolerant because it is a <strong>redundant network</strong>. There are <em>multiple pathways</em> among its physical connections to create <em>redundancy</em>. Even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from sender to receiver (as shown right). Software in the connection points knows how to re-route data if one connection fails.</li>\n            <li>Data is transmitted via <strong>open protocols</strong>. Protocols <em>standardize</em> communication, so all data is sent by the same rules for sending and receiving the data. These protocols are <em>open</em> (available for use by anyone) to ensure that anyone can build systems that connect to the Internet.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Internet isn't just a network of computers, though. It's a <em>network of networks</em>. The connection points between networks are called <strong>routers</strong>, networking devices that route traffic between subnetworks on the Internet. Making sense of the information happens at the destination computer.</p>\n    <div class=\"sidenote\"> <small>Image from <a href=\"http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=685\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Digital Dandelions: The flowering of network research\">UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering</a>.</small></div>\n    <div class=\"vocabBig\">\n        <ul>\n            <li>A <strong>router</strong> is a computer that passes information from one network to another.</li>\n            <p>Your computer probably uses a router that is somewhere in your home to connect to your <em>ISP</em>.</p>\n            <li><strong>ISPs</strong> (Internet Service Providers) are the companies who sell Internet access to homes and institutions.</li>\n            <p>The computers connected to the Internet and the connections among them don't belong to any one organization.

He is one of the early inventors of the wireless ad hoc networks, a temporary decentralized type of wireless network that enables all mobile phones to work today.

This is achieved by building many <em>redundant</em> connections into the physical systems of the Internet. That way, if part of the Internet fails, data can be re-routed via a different <em>path</em>. And such changes to the path can happen in transit because <em>routing</em> on the Internet is dynamic; it is not specified in advance. Creating such redundancy can require additional resources (such as additional computers and cables) but it also increases the Internet's <em>fault tolerance</em> (ability to work around problems) and helps the Internet <em>scale</em> (expand) to more devices and people.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"forYouToDo\" id=\"first\">\n        <ol>\n            <li>\n                <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png\" alt=\"Talk with Your Partner\" title=\"Talk with Your Partner\" /> Describe what's going on in this animation.<br />\n                <div class=\"todo\">Someone should follow-up with Dan about where these images came from. --MF, 8/29/19</div>\n                <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/4-internet/redundancy.gif\" alt=\"A network of nodes joined with edges, with a sender node and a receiver node.

How do they all know how to find and talk to each other? <em>Protocols</em> (communication standards) ensure that the variety of devices interact with each other smoothly.</p>\n    <p>Every device on the Internet has a unique <em>Internet Protocol (IP) address</em> (or more than one, if it's a router), like a postal or email address. The <em>Internet Protocol</em> specifies how a router handles a request for a different IP address. Each router knows the layout of its specific neighborhood of the Internet and knows which way to send each message to get it a little bit closer to where it's going. The fact that each router doesn't have to know the addresses of the complete Internet improves scalability.</p>\n    <p>When you stream data over the Internet, the stream is divided into <em>packets</em> that IP sends individually.

One way to tolerate faults is not to care (if you lose one frame of video, it doesn't matter). Another way (called <em>TCP</em> for Transmission Control Protocol) is to keep sending packets until they are acknowledged as having been received correctly.  For applications that use TCP, it's TCP that divides the data into packets.  Since packets can travel by different paths, they may arrive out of order; and despite the redundancy of the Internet, it's possible some won't arrive at all.

DNS (Domain Name System) converts user-friendly host names (like edc.org or berkeley.edu) into IP addresses. Your email application may use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) to read email.</p>\n        <p><strong>Transport layer:</strong> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) <em>simulates</em> a reliable, long-term connection between two computers by only displaying data once all packets have arrived. When speed is more important than accuracy, such as for real-time video streaming, people use UDP (User Datagram Protocol).</p>\n        <p><strong>Internet layer:</strong> Every device on the Internet needs an IP address so other devices can find it. Routers use Internet layer protocols to detect and work around network congestion.</p>\n        <p><strong>Network interface hardware:</strong> You may connect to the Internet with an <em>Ethernet</em> cable or perhaps a <em>WiFi</em> radio antenna inside the case of your computer. Either connects computers to a local network router which then connects to an Internet service provider (ISP). Cell phones use a longer-range <em>cellular</em> connection to a phone carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>There are a <em>lot</em> of protocols! The Internet was designed with several layers of <em>abstraction</em> that sort the protocols according to what part of the process they support. This <em>hierarchy of abstractions</em> manages the complexity of the Internet by hiding the details of lower levels of the system: </p>    \n    <div>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Application Layer Protocols</strong> (such as HTTP) are the highest level of abstraction because they<em> manage how data is interpreted and displayed</em> to users. These protocols <em>give meaning to the bits</em> sent by lower-level protocols; user and server computers must agree on what the bits mean, and application protocols offer this.</li>\n            <li><strong>Transport Layer Protocols</strong> (such as TCP) manage the <em>breakdown of a message into packets</em> to be transmitted by lower level protocols and also the  <em>reconstruction of the message from the packets</em> upon arrival.</li>\n            <li><strong>Internet Layer Protocols</strong> (such as IP) <em>manage the pathways that the data packets travel</em> across networks. These protocols provide an abstraction of the Internet as one large network even though the physical reality on the lower level is one of many  subnetworks.</li>\n            <li><strong>Network Interface Hardware</strong> (using Link Layer Protocols such as WiFi) manage the connection between an Internet device and its  local network. These local protocols are the least abstract because they deal directly with your physical hardware.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"comment\">CSN-1.B.4 (paragraph about \"open standards\")</div>\n    <div class=\"takeNote\">These are all <em>open standards</em>: anyone can look up a protocol and code with it to make new hardware or software without anyone's permission.

It's true that free cooperation plays an important role, but people can't just pick any IP address or host name they want, or else there would be conflicts. For example, we can't start a server named bjc.org, because that name is already in use (by a health care provider in St. Louis, Missouri). Until 2009, the Internet  <strong><a href=\"/cur/programming/4-internet/old/4-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment\" title=\"Address Hierarchy\">domain name hierarchy</a></strong> was entirely controlled by the United States government, with the details delegated to ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). </p>\n    <div class=\"endnote\">In 2009 the US Department of Commerce signed a new agreement with ICANN recognizing it as an independent, multinational organization, although it is still under contract with the Department of Commerce to maintain certain principles. International critics are still not satisfied that ICANN is truly independent of the United States.</div>\n    \n    \n    <h2>The Power of Open Protocols</h2>\n    <p>The growth of the Internet has been fueled by <strong>open protocols</strong>, standards that are <em>not owned by a company</em>.</p>\n    <div class=\"takeNote\">\n        Examples of open protocols:\n          <ul>\n            <li>Standards for <em>sharing information</em> and <em>communicating between browsers and servers</em> on the Web include <strong>HTTP</strong>, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (<strong>SMTP</strong>) and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (<strong>SSL</strong>/<strong>TLS</strong>)</li>\n            <li>Standards for <em>packets and routing</em> include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (<strong>TCP</strong>/<strong>IP</strong>).</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    <p>The protocols for the Internet change over time.

Decisions are made by consensus (everyone has to agree to a change), never by voting. The idea is that if a proposal is controversial enough to need a vote, then it should be improved until everyone's objections are satisfied. Unlike ICANN, the IETF has been remarkably free from political pressure, even though it, too, has historically been dominated by experts from the United States.</p>\n            <p>The Internet Society (ISOC) is a worldwide nonprofit membership society that <em>anyone</em> can join, for free. It is now officially in charge of the IETF and also conducts education and promotes government policies supporting an open Internet.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    \n    <h2>The Issue of US Control</h2>\n    <!--<img class=\"imageRight\" src=\"/img/4-internet/snowden.png\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Edward Snowden\" title=\"Edward Snowden\" />-->\n    <p>If you think it's strange for one country to control a worldwide network, you're not alone. Other countries have never been happy about the US control of the Internet, which was <em>officially</em> under US control until 2009 and is still, according to many critics, unofficially dominated by the US government.</p>\n    <div class=\"endnote\">For example until 2009, all DNS domain names had to use the English alphabet, despite constant requests to accommodate other languages. </div>\n    <p>The issue of US control has become much more heated since 2013 when Edward Snowden (shown right, source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wikipedia: Edward Snowden\">Wikipedia</a>) exposed the US National Security Agency (NSA) for spying on Internet traffic worldwide.

In 1969, the first connections were made among four university research groups. At its peak, the ARPANET reached a few hundred computers. (All those computers were owned either by military installations or by computer science research labs, mostly at universities.) </p>\n            <p>The ARPANET was tiny, but it inspired the protocols that became foundation of the Internet. And it belonged to the US military.</p>\n            <p>Once IP was invented in 1982, the ARPANET became just one network among many, and it was decommissioned in 1990. And in 1981, the National Science Foundation (NSF, a civilian agency of the US government that also funded the development of this curriculum) had built the core of a new cross-country network. At that time, businesses still weren't allowed on the network, but there was a clear demand. So, commercial IP-based networks were created.</p>\n            <a href=\"#hint-commerce\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" title=\"How did we move from research to commerce?\">How did we move from research to commerce?</a>\n            <div id=\"hint-commerce\" class=\"collapse\">\n                <p>During all this time, the assignment of IP addresses and host names was <em>controlled first by the ARPA and later by NSF</em>.

How do we know what \"hard\" means? For example, current cryptographic methods rely on the difficulty of finding prime factors of very large numbers. There's no <em>proof</em> that someone won't come up with a fast way to do that, but people are pretty confident about it because the problem has been well studied by many mathematicians. (On the other hand, when <em>quantum computers</em> become practical, factorization <em>will</em> be easy, and new cryptographic methods will be needed. New research developments in 2019 make practical quantum cryptanalysis seem not so far away.)</p>\n            <p>What makes it possible for mathematicians to study the difficulty of breaking Internet cryptography is that the method used&mdash;the cryptographic function&mdash;is openly published. This may seem strange; if you want to keep secrets, shouldn't you keep the technique secret, too? But secret algorithms can have weaknesses that go undiscovered until some bad guy exploits them. Open standards allow an algorithm to be studied <em>before</em> it is used in practice.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    \n    <h2>Certificate Authorities</h2>\n    <div class=\"vocabBig\">\n        <div class=\"comment\">IOC-2.B.6</div>\n        <p><strong>Certificate authorities</strong> are organizations that issue digital certificates to verify who owns the encryption keys used for secured communications.</p>\n        <p>Instead of trusting that the website is who they say they are, you now have to trust that the Certificate Authority is reliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Public key cryptography doesn't solve all the problems, because an eavesdropper (say, Eve) might publish a fake public key pretending to be Alice. Then Bob might accidentally encrypt his message to Alice using Eve's fake key, and then only Eve can read the message meant for Alice.  In practice, this is partly fixed by relying on trusted third parties, called <em>Certificate Authorities</em>, to certify public keys. In your browser's security options you can see all of the Certificate Authorities that it trusts.</p>\n    <div class=\"endnote\">But this just pushes the problem back a layer. How does the Certificate Authorities know that you are who you say you are? The problem is a little bit like how your bank knows that you who you say you are when you call them on the phone.

And computers controlling critical social infrastructure (such as power plants, telephone switching systems, traffic lights, and hospital equipment) can be attacked by criminals and other countries' militaries. </p>\n    \n    <h2>Common Security Issues for Users</h2>\n    <div class=\"comment\">design flaws: IOC-2.B.10, anti-virus and anti-malware: IOC-2.C.7, phishing: IOC-2.C.1</div>\n    <div class=\"vocabBig\">\n        <div class=\"commentBig\">malware: IOC-2.B.9, keylogging: IOC-2.C.2, virus: IOC-2.B.8, antivirus or anti-malware software: IOC-2.B.7, phishing: IOC-2.C.1</div>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Malware</strong> is software that was designed to harm or take partial control over your computer.</li>\n            <li><strong>Keylogging software</strong> is a kind of malware that records every key pressed by a user.</li>\n            <li>A <strong>computer virus</strong> is a type of malware that spreads and infects other computers. Viruses can attach themselves to legitimate programs.</li>\n            <li><strong>Antivirus or anti-malware software</strong> is software designed to scan your files and Internet transmissions looking for malware.</li>\n            <li>A <strong>firewall</strong> is a security system that controls the kinds of connections that can be made between a computer or network and the outside world.</li>\n            <li><strong>Phishing</strong> is a common security attack in which the victim is tricked into giving up personal information or downloading malware.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    <p>Software has <em>bugs</em> (even published software written by professionals).  And people can use those bugs for bad purposes (such as crashing your computer or implanting <em>keylogging software</em> to collect everything you type, including passwords and other confidential information).  Software developers try to prevent security bugs and fix them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes fixes promptly. (And not every computer user keeps up with software updates perfectly!)</p>\n    <p>The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly is <em>malware</em>. You computer can end up with malware if you or someone using your computer downloads untrustworthy software (such as from freeware or shareware sites; not everything on those sites is bad, but if you aren't careful, you might install something that is).</p>\n    <p>One kind of malware is called a <em>virus</em>.  Computer viruses make copies of themselves (just as biological viruses do) and try to spread themselves over the network to other computers. People use <em>antivirus software</em> to help prevent these attacks. People also use <em>firewalls</em> to limit connections into or out of their computer. (Both your computer and your router probably run firewall software.)</p>\n    <p>Another common attack strategy is called <em>phishing:</em> an attacker sends you an email that appears to be from some official organization (such as your bank) and tricks you into giving information to the attackers (such as your bank password). The attacker can then use your personal information to gain access to sensitive online resources, such as your bank accounts or emails.</p>\n    \n    <div class=\"forYouToDo\">\n        <ol>\n            <div class=\"comment\">IOC-2.C</div>\n            <li><img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/icons/write-out-thoughts.png\" alt=\"Write Out Your Thoughts\" title=\"Write Out Your Thoughts\" />Describe three ways someone could gain unauthorized access to your computer or data.</li>\n            <div class=\"comment\">IOC-2.B</div>\n            <li>Describe an example of a computer security issue that you or someone you know know has experienced or could experience.</li>\n        </ol>\n    </div>\n    \n    <h2>Common Security Issues with Public Systems</h2>\n    <p>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack consists of sending a lot of requests to a server at the same time (for instance, requests for a web page or some data). This can overload the server's network bandwidth. A DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a temporary inability to reach the targeted server so other users of that server are denied service.</p>\n    <div class=\"vocabBig\">\n        <p>A <strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack</strong> uses a virus to flood a server with many requests from many computers at once so that users of that server are denied service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A variant is the <em>Distributed Denial of Service</em> (DDoS) attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses and other malware to take control of many (sometimes hundreds of thousands of) computers around the world. This network of infected computers is called a <em>botnet</em>. The attacker then launches a DoS attack from all of the victims' computers at the same time. Besides increasing the number of simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"comment\">rogue access point: IOC-2.C.3, IOC-2.C.4</div>\n    <p>Unless your data is encrypted, it can be read or modified as it's being sent over public networks.  One way that this can happen is through a <em>rogue access point</em>.</p>\n    <div class=\"vocabFullWidth\">: <p>A <strong>rogue access&nbsp;point</strong> is a wireless access point that gives access to a secure network without the authorization of the network administrator.</p></div>\n    <p>A rogue access point may be installed by someone trying to improve access to the network or by an attacker. But either way, the lack of proper security can allow data being sent over that WiFi network to be intercepted. For example, if your computer has password access to a WiFi network, and you enable Bluetooth network sharing, you are allowing anyone in Bluetooth range of your computer access to the secure network.</p>\n    \n    <h2>Is Too Much Security Possible?</h2>\n    <p>Too much security has its own set of problems. A perfectly secure Internet would prevent anonymous publishing, restricting freedom of speech.  To prevent fraud, it's important to be able to verify the source of a message, but if the source of a message can be verified, the message can't be anonymous. That's problematic both for privacy and for freedom of speech.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"forYouToDo\">\n        <ol start=\"3\">\n            <li>\n                This question is similar to those you will see on the AP CSP exam.\n                <!--I added this question from the edX version: https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/BJC.3x/1T2016/courseware/617886fc39ea449887a2c3b11f8283f3/6564744921ab4839bec2ae0c01e174ae/ --MF 12/17/16 -->\n                <!-- Question 1 -->\n                <div class=\"assessment-data\" type=\"multiplechoice\" identifier=\"Which of the following are existing vulnerabilities of the Internet, according to experts?\" hasinlinefeedback=\"true\" maxchoices=\"3\" responseIdentifier=\"ri1\" shuffle=\"false\">\n                    <div class=\"prompt\">Which of the following are existing vulnerabilities of the Internet, according to experts?</div>\n                    <div class=\"choice\" identifier=\"c1\">\n                        <div class=\"text\">A physical attack that involves cutting fiber-optic cables.</div>\n                        <div class=\"feedback\">Yes, but there may be more!</div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"choice\" identifier=\"c2\">\n                        <div class=\"text\">Attacking electrical systems that control the energy grid.</div>\n                        <div class=\"feedback\">Yes, but there may be more!</div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"choice\" identifier=\"c3\">\n                        <div class=\"text\">Eroding the trust and confidence that the general public has in their online privacy and secure online transactions.</div>\n                        <div class=\"feedback\">Yes, but there may be more!</div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"responseDeclaration\" identifier=\"ri1\">\n                        <div class=\"correctResponse\" identifier=\"c1\"></div>\n                        <div class=\"correctResponse\" identifier=\"c2\"></div>\n                        <div class=\"correctResponse\" identifier=\"c3\"></div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </li>\n        </ol>\n    </div>\n    \n  \n</body>"

The only good solution is to use a <em>password manager,</em> a program that makes up a random password for every site.  You just remember one password, the one for the password manager itself.  It takes care of your other ones for you.  </li>  \n                    <li><strong>Enable multifactor authentication</strong> (such as two-factor authentication) so you can only access your device or account after entering specific information (typically one is a password and the other requires another of your devices or accounts or the other uses something that detects your body like a fingerprint reader). It may feel like a hassle, but each step added to the login progress adds another layer of security. </li>\n                </ol>\n            </li>\n            <li><strong>Don't click links</strong> on websites or especially in email, <strong>without first double-checking</strong> that the actual URL in the link is what you expect.

If a computer or account of someone you know has been compromised, you may receive emails appearing to come from them that contain malicious links that could compromise your system or account. As you know, it's important to keep your software up-to-date, but a common trick is a pop up window asking you to download an update.

Music synthesizers, for example, are electronic musical instruments that allow musicians to simulate the sound of dozens of different kinds of instrument without actually having or being able to play them. When synthesizers were first invented, some artists considered this cheating. The 1975 Queen album <em>A Night at the Opera,</em> the one with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" on it, for example, had the words \"No synthesizers!\" featured in the liner notes. Today, of course, digital synthesizers (as well as more specialized computerized instruments such as drum machines) are commonplace in popular music.

In biology, the central example is <em>DNA sequencing.</em>  DNA, the fundamental \"blueprint\" for all living organisms, consists of very long molecules; human DNA includes over <em>three billion</em> tiny building blocks.  Modern supercomputers make it possible for human researchers to perform computations to analyze these sequences.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"comment\">IOC-1.E.2 (\"Another important topic in biochemistry\")</div>\n    <img style=\"clear: both;\" class=\"imageRight\" alt=\"protein before and after folding\" title=\"protein before and after folding\" src=\"/img/4-internet/protein-folding.png\" caption=\"Wikipedia, public domain\" />\n    <div class=\"sidenote\">\n        <p>Early Minimoog synthesizer image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:R.A.Moog_minimoog_2.jpg\" title=\"Wikipedia user Magnus Manske\">Wikipedia user Magnus Manske</a>; protein folding image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Protein_folding.png\" title=\"Wikipedia user DrKjaergaard\">Wikipedia user DrKjaergaard</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Another important topic in biochemistry is <em>protein folding.</em>  When your body needs to produce a protein molecule, it \"folds\" another molecule into the right shape. Certain diseases are the result of proteins folding incorrectly, and researchers want to find the correct folding (the correct shape) for every protein. But trying every possibility requires enormous amounts of computer time. So, the <em>Folding@home</em> group at Stanford University asks people to download a protein folding program that will run on your computer or phone only when you're not doing something else with it. Working together, tens of thousands of computers are like a very large supercomputer, except that supercomputers are expensive, while putting your computer's idle time to work doesn't cost anything.</p>\n    <p>Folding@home is just one of several <em>citizen science</em> projects.  The first one was the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, which uses volunteered computer time to search for large prime numbers, which are of importance in public key cryptography. Another early citizen science project, probably the most famous, is SETI@home, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, created by astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley.  This project searches the pictures produced by large telescopes for radio signals that could be produced by intelligent life on a faraway planet.

But after some Folding@home users declared that they could find protein folds faster than a computer could do it, biochemists at the University of Washington collaborated with computer scientists in the UW Center for Game Science to create a video game, Foldit, in which you get points for folding proteins correctly.  People carry out computations much more slowly than computers, but people can look at a picture, such as a picture of a protein, and take in the whole shape at once, instantly seeing possible folds.  Computers, so far, can't do that instant analysis of a picture as a whole.</p>\n            <p>They didn't have to make Foldit a game; they could have just presented it as an opportunity to help science.  But turning it into a game sparks some people's competitive spirit and gets them to try harder and for a longer period of time than they might without the \"gamification\" of the task.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"comment\">IOC-1.E.6 (\"Another kind of crowdsourced collaboration\")</div>\n    <p>Another kind of crowdsourced collaboration involves money.  When a natural disaster leaves many people homeless, websites such as <a href=\"http://gofundme.com\" title=\"gofundme.com\" target=\"_blank\">gofundme.com</a> let large numbers of people contribute small amounts of money that add up to enough to make a difference.  The contributors don't expect anything back for their contributions.  Similarly, small businesses can post notices at <a href=\"http://kickstarter.com\" title=\"kickstarter.com\" target=\"_blank\">kickstarter.com</a> encouraging supporters to buy a product before it exists; the developers use the money to pay the initial development and manufacturing costs, and then give the supporters their purchases.</p>\n    \n    <div class=\"comment\">IOC-1.E.1 (\"Advances in technology\")</div>\n    <p>Advances in technology have also allowed widespread access to information and public data, which facilitates the identification of problems, the development of solutions, and dissemination of the results.

There are thousands of prescription medications available in the United States, and there are medicines available without a prescription that may interact as well.  Doctors can't possibly remember the drug interactions for every pair of medicines, but they can use medical databases to check for drug interactions online.

But it turned out also to be good for organizing group activities, such as political protests and disaster support; computing innovations often have unintended beneficial effects in other fields. Facebook's ability to make money could have been based on charging a fee for a Facebook account, but instead they chose to make the accounts free and to make money by using people's data to provide advertising targeted to that user's interests.  You learned about how Facebook collects personal data even without users' knowledge in <a href=\"/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-privacy/2-examining-privacy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment\" title=\"Unit 1 Lab 4 Page 2: Examining Privacy\">Unit 1 Lab 4 Page 2: Examining Privacy</a>, and this information gathering was intentionally designed into Facebook.  But one thing Facebook <em>didn't</em> intend was the ability of political campaigns and foreign countries to post content <em>lying</em> about opposing candidates that spreads rapidly throughout the network. This is a harmful impact on society. Technological innovations can also have harmful effects on economy or culture in addition to the many possible benefits.</p>\n    <p>When Facebook started, it was available only to Harvard students.  If that were still the case, neither its good nor its bad effects would matter very much.  When Facebook expanded to include almost everyone with a computer or a smartphone, its impact expanded, and now dishonest political messages can spread around the world very quickly.</p>\n    <div class=\"comment\">IOC-1.A.4</div>\n    <p>A single effect of an innovation can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person. You might not like your personal data being collected and shared with other companies, but violating people's privacy isn't bad for Mark Zuckerberg; on the contrary, it made him one of the richest people on Earth. And you might appreciate seeing advertisements that are relevant to you and still dislike the privacy violation.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"forYouToDo\">\n        <ol start=\"3\">\n            <!--<div class=\"comment\">CRD-2.A</div>\n            <li>Make a chart like this one for distributing music digitally over the net (e.g., iTunes, Spotify).

Instead, innovations are designed by a <em>team</em> that includes potential users, from a variety of cultures, ideally by choosing diverse technical experts (programmers, graphic artists, user interface experts, and others) who'll do the actual implementation and who clearly understand the purpose of the innovation.  In addition, modern innovators survey large numbers of users outside their team to double-check that everyone's expectations are satisfied.  (This is why you may see invitations from a company to \"alpha test\" a new program.  It's only partly to help catch out-and-out bugs; it also finds out early if some users are going to get angry about something the developers never considered.</p>\n    <div class=\"todo\">\n        CRD-1.A.4: Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations.<br />\n        ALREADY COVERED IOC-1.F.11: Computing innovations can raise legal and ethical concerns. Some examples of these include:<br />\n●       the development of algorithms that include bias<br />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment\">CRD-1.A.4, IOC-1.F.11(2)</div>\n    <p>Another reason a variety of people on the design team is desirable is to help avoid <em>bias</em> in the innovation.  In some early testing of self-driving cars, it was found that they weren't good at detecting pedestrians who were people of color.  This wasn't deliberate, of course; the artificial intelligence program that detected pedestrians had been trained on a vast collection of photographs of people, in which all the people happened to be light-skinned.  Luckily this problem was discovered in early testing, before the self-driving cars were really sent out on the road.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"todo\">\n        CRD-1.B.1: Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment\">CRD-1.B.1 (next four paragraphs)</div>\n    <p>How do computers and the Internet enable collaboration?  The way that's most taken for granted is the worldwide telephone system.  Telephones are older than computers, but the early telephone systems didn't have area codes, let alone country codes.  You could dial people in your town, but to call anyone else you had to ask an operator (a telephone company worker) to connect you by hand.  Today, connecting telephone calls is done by computer, and you can dial just about any telephone on Earth yourself.</p>\n    <p>Computers are more visibly involved when you use virtual meeting software.  Skype, the best-known example, is free in the sense of not costing you money to use it (although not in the sense of giving you the right to see or modify the software).  But Skype's free service degrades significantly if more than two or three people are on the call.  Both Skype and other companies offer commercial virtual meeting software that can connect dozens of users with good quality.</p>\n    <p>Besides talking with each other, developers can collaborate on <em>multi-author documents</em> using software that allows them to share the ownership of an online document.  The best-known such system is Google Docs; like Skype, it's free in the money sense but not in the sense of sharing the software that implements it.</p>\n    <p>Systems that allow several people to edit the same document at the same time have the problem that one person's edits may contradict another person's.  <em>Revision control systems,</em> of which the best-known is Git (free in both senses), support a more complicated but safer kind of collaboration:  Each person has a private copy of the shared document, and edits that copy.  When a collaborator is ready to share an edit with the rest of the team, the software <em>synchronizes</em> the local changes with the online, shared version.  If changes from two collaborators conflict, the software won't allow the synchronization until the conflicting text is resolved.  The software also remembers the complete history of who changed what when, so it's possible to undo a change even if other parts of the document have changed since then.  But succeeding with Git does require a certain level of expertise.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"forYouToDo\">\n        <ol>\n            <div class=\"comment\">CRD-1.B</div>\n            <li>Research other forms of collaboration technology.

Don't worry about the details; just notice the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph. <!--With a very small input (cutoff) or a very large input (saturation), the output is relatively unchanged by small variations.--> Within the \"cutoff\" region, small changes to the input voltage do not change the output voltage at all; the output is always <em>zero</em> volts. Likewise within the \"saturation\" region, small input changes don't affect the output voltage; this output is interpreted as a <em>one</em>. This is how transistors are used as <em>switches</em> in a computer.  If there were three flat parts of the curve, maybe we <em>would</em> have three possible values for each wire.</p>\n            <p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle, linear (pink) part of the graph, they're <em>amplifiers</em>; a small variation in input voltage produces a <em>large</em> variation in output voltage. That's how they're used to play music in a stereo. </p>\n            <p style=\"clear: both; height: 0px;\"></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <p>\n        <div class=\"comment\">DAT-1.A.2</div>\n        Instead of multiple-valued wires, we <em>use more than one bit</em> if we need to represent more than two possible values.

This means that every ten bits of width multiplies the number of values that can be represented by about 1000.

The first officially recognized character encoding was the seven bit ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set. It included an optional eighth bit for error detection, which was taken over to include accented characters in Spanish, French, German, and some other European languages. For example, there is an accented character in the name of the main developer of Snap<em>!</em>, Jens Mönig, who is German. (The closest English sound is the \"u\" in \"lunch.\")</p>\n    \n   <p>As the use of computers and the Internet spread around the world, people wanted to be able to write Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Kabyle, Russian, Tamil, etc. The <em>Unicode</em> character set supports about 1900 languages, using 32 modern alphabets and 107 historical alphabets that are no longer in living use.

The information in storage—whether it is a text message, a photograph, a song, a computer program, or a list of phone numbers—all looks the same, like a sequence of bits that are either On or Off (one or zero), a <em>binary sequence</em>.</p>\n    \n    <div class=\"endnote\">\n        <p><a href=\"#hint-size-table\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" title=\"How much information fits in a gigbyte?\">How much information fits in a gigabyte?</a></p>\n        <div id=\"hint-size-table\" class=\"collapse\">\n            <p>Here are a few rough examples of what kind of data would fit in how much memory:</p>\n            <table class=\"byte indent\" summary=\"table of common data sizes\">\n                <tr>\n                    <th scope=\"col\">name</th>\n                    <th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:300px;\">amount</th>\n                    <th scope=\"col\" style=\"width:300px;\">example</th>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>bit</td>\n                    <td>either a 1 or a 0</td>\n                    <td>1</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>byte</td>\n                    <td>8 bits</td>\n                    <td>11011001</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>kilobyte</td>\n                    <td>2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) bytes</td>\n                    <td>a couple of paragraphs</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>megabyte</td>\n                    <td>2<sup>20</sup> (1,048,576) bytes</td>\n                    <td>about 1 book</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>gigabyte</td>\n                    <td>2<sup>30</sup> (1,073,741,824) bytes</td>\n                    <td>a little more than 1 CD</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>terabyte</td>\n                    <td>2<sup>40</sup> (1,099,511,627,776) bytes</td>\n                    <td>about 1,500 CDs</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>petabyte</td>\n                    <td>2<sup>50</sup> (1,125,899,906,842,624) bytes</td>\n                    <td>about 20 million filing cabinets of text</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>exabyte</td>\n                    <td>2<sup>60</sup> (1,152,921,504,606,846,976) bytes</td>\n                    <td>about 20% of all the words ever spoken by humankind</td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n            <p>As we write this in 2017, it's common to have a terabyte disk drive on your desk.

But it's not always obvious how best to represent a value in a computer program. For example, the most straightforward way to represent an amount of money is in <em>floating point</em> because it allows for decimals. But if you use floating point to store a value like 3.20, it's likely to be displayed to the user as 3.2, and people rarely write money this way. Instead, even though it's more programming effort, you might choose to create an abstract data type <code>money, dollars: ( ) cents: ( )</code> with two integer inputs so that you can control how the value is displayed.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"takeNote\">\n        <div class=\"comment\">DAT-1.B.3</div>\n        <p>Floating point allows computers to store very large numbers and also decimals, but the format still has a specific number of bits, and that limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations just as with integers.

If so, can we move it up?\n    <br />\n    No, sorry.  The type encoding works fine. In bignum mode you get correct answers. In non-bignum (floating point), the issue is that in <em>binary</em> floating point, 1/10 is an infinite fraction, like 1/3 in decimal.

For example:\n        <ul>\n            <li>A Boolean value is a single bit, 0 for <code>false</code> and 1 for <code>true</code>.</li>\n            <li>A text string is a sequence of Unicode character codes, each of which is stored as a separate integer.</li>\n            <li>Lists and blocks are binary sequences too.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"endnote\">\n        <a href=\"#hint-data-types\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" title=\"But different languages use data types differently\">But different languages use data types differently.</a>\n        <div id=\"hint-data-types\" class=\"collapse\">\n            <p>\n                In well-designed languages (those based on Scheme, for example), that data type code is attached to the value itself. In other languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't both get exact answers when the values are integers and also be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable.

Unless we are getting into optional/TIF territory, I would stick to 2 to 10 and 10 to 2 and just say that the same alg works for other bases (maybe even show an example like the code for () base 7 or something).

The most commonly used lossy compression algorithm for pictures is called JPEG (or JPG, both pronounced \"jay peg\" for \"Joint Photographic Experts Group,\" the committee that invented it). JPEG works by preserving most of the brightness information for each pixel (since human eyes are sensitive to that) and performing a kind of averaging process to the color information (because human eyes aren't as good at distinguishing color, especially colors close to white).</p>\n    <p>\n        Below are an original, uncompressed picture of pebbles in a pond and a highly compressed JPEG of the same image.

But the compressed file uses 1/30th of the space used by the original, and you could still tell that it's a picture of rocks. So, for many purposes the compressed version would be good enough. Lossy algorithms usually let you <em>control the degree of precision</em>, and generally, people select less extreme compression settings, so the compressed file looks much more like the original than this example.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"endnote\">\n        <p><a href=\"#hint-sizes\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" title=\"What size is this file when encoded in different formats?\">What size is this file when encoded in different formats?</a></p>\n        <div id=\"hint-sizes\" class=\"collapse\">\n            Here are the sizes of the pond pebbles picture in four different formats:\n            <table class=\"byte indent\" width=\"56%\" summary=\"compression factors example\">\n                <tr>\n                    <th scope=\"col\">format</th>\n                    <th scope=\"col\">size</th>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"text-align: left;\">BMP encoding every pixel individually (shown above)</td>\n                    <td>148 kB</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"text-align: left;\">PNG</td>\n                    <td>106 kB</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"text-align: left;\">JPEG with least compression</td>\n                    <td>94 kB</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"text-align: left;\">JPEG with most compression (shown above)</td>\n                    <td>5 kB</td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>The MP3 format, which you almost certainly use for portable music files, is a lossy compression format.

Drag one block underneath another to snap them together.\n\n\n \n\nCRD-2.B.1\n\n\nThis is a computer program, also known as software. It’s a very short one, but it’ll get more interesting soon.\n\n\n\nTest your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the stage several times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.\n\n\nIf your program doesn’t work, look back at the picture of the code and make sure yours matches exactly.\n\n\nMake sure the two blocks are attached to each other by moving the when I am clicked block and checking that the go to block moves with it.\n\n\nMake sure that the first block says when I am (clicked) and not something else, and make sure that the second block says go to (random position) and not something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrange boxes contain the ideas you should still remember three years from now.\n\n  \n\nCRD-2.C.2, CRD-2.C.3, CRD-2.C.5\n\n\nBlocks that look like this can be used to detect an event such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap! programmers call them “hat blocks.” Using events to control a program is called event-driven programming.\n\n\nNot every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind when I am (clicked) and when (space) key pressed in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a good idea to save your project every so often.\n\n\n\n\nChoose “Save” from the Snap! File menu, .\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game Challenging\n\n\n\nThe game isn’t much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked. Once you’ve clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says “do this forever.” And there is a block that does it: \n\n\n\n\n\nA bunch of blocks clicked together is called a script.\n\nAttach this to the bottom of your Alonzo script: \n\nThe sequence of blocks inside the forever block will repeat until you click the red stop sign, , or stop the script in some other way.\n\n\nClick for an animation of snapping these two blocks together.\n\n<img class=\"indent\" data-gifffer=\"/img/1-introduction/snap-blocks.gif\" alt=\"animation showing the block go to (position) being snapped inside a forever block\" title=\"animation showing the block go to (position) being snapped inside a forever block\" />\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonzo moves too fast. Use the  block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.\n\nWhere the wait block goes in your script matters. Do you want the script to wait one time or each time Alonzo moves?"

    "text": "Giving the Player Feedback\n\nNow the game is challenging, but players can’t tell how well they’re doing because Alonzo jumps around whether the player clicks him or not. On this page, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.\n\n\nConfirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked\n\n\nFirst, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.\n\n\n: Sprites and Costumes\n\nThe Alonzo character is named after Alonzo Church, a major contributor to early computer science. In this project, there are three objects related to Alonzo:\n\n\nOne is a sprite, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.\n\n\nThe other two are costumes, picture that can be \"worn\" by a sprite.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.   \n\n\nThe project you loaded has two Alonzo costumes—one facing right and the other facing left—so you can use the  block to make the sprite face the other way. Add the next costume block to the place in your program where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.\n\n\nTest your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is clicked but not when he jumps without being clicked.\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Score\n\n\n\nThe player will also want to know how much progress they have made in the game. The command  can control Alonzo’s transparency.\n\n\n\nThe transparency of an image is how much you can see what’s behind it. For example, here is the Alonzo sprite shown with three different transparencies (which have been set using the ghost effect block). \n\n\n\n\nUse transparency to tell the user how close they are to winning: every time they click, Alonzo gets more invisible, and when he disappears completely, they win the game.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the change (ghost) effect block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does. At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible? You can use the command  to make Alonzo fully opaque again.\n\n\nThen, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly. Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game. Try out your game.\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game More Challenging\n\n\nSo far, even a bad player will eventually make Alonzo disappear. The game will be much more interesting if the player is penalized for missing a click.\n\n\n\n\nFigure out where to add a change (ghost) effect by (-5) block to your script to make Alonzo get less transparent any time he moves without being clicked.\n\n\nPlay your game a few times, and adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.\n\n\nYou can change the change effect input number (for either instance of the block) and/or the wait time to make the game easier or harder.\n\n\n\n\nEnding the Game\n\n\n\nWhen Alonzo is completely transparent, the game should stop.\n\n\n\nAdd this code to the right place in your script to end the game."

(Alonzo might say, “Welcome to ‘Click Alonzo!’ Keep clicking me if you can!”)\n\n\nMake that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.\n\nThe say block with an empty text in the white input slot will make the sprite say nothing.\n\n\n\nCheck that your app does everything you want:\n\n\nWhen the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.\n\n\nWhen Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and get more transparent.\n\n\nAlonzo should start to reappear (but shouldn’t face the other way) any time he moves without being clicked."

    "text": "Giving the Player Feedback\n\nNow the game is challenging, but players can’t tell how well they’re doing because Alonzo jumps around whether the player clicks him or not. On this page, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.\n\n\nConfirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked\n\n\nFirst, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.\n\n\n: Sprites and Costumes\n\nThe Alonzo character is named after Alonzo Church, a major contributor to early computer science. In this project, there are three objects related to Alonzo:\n\n\nOne is a sprite, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.\n\n\nThe other two are costumes, picture that can be \"worn\" by a sprite.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.   \n\n\nThe project you loaded has two Alonzo costumes—one facing right and the other facing left—so you can use the  block to make the sprite face the other way. Add the next costume block to the place in your program where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.\n\n\nTest your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is clicked but not when he jumps without being clicked.\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Score\n\n\n\nThe player will also want to know how much progress they have made in the game. The command  can control Alonzo’s transparency.\n\n\n\nThe transparency of an image is how much you can see what’s behind it. For example, here is the Alonzo sprite shown with three different transparencies (which have been set using the ghost effect block). \n\n\n\n\nUse transparency to tell the user how close they are to winning: every time they click, Alonzo gets more invisible, and when he disappears completely, they win the game.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the change (ghost) effect block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does. At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible? You can use the command  to make Alonzo fully opaque again.\n\n\nThen, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly. Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game. Try out your game.\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game More Challenging\n\n\nSo far, even a bad player will eventually make Alonzo disappear. The game will be much more interesting if the player is penalized for missing a click.\n\n\n\n\nFigure out where to add a change (ghost) effect by (-5) block to your script to make Alonzo get less transparent any time he moves without being clicked.\n\n\nPlay your game a few times, and adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.\n\n\nYou can change the change effect input number (for either instance of the block) and/or the wait time to make the game easier or harder.\n\n\n\n\nEnding the Game\n\n\n\nWhen Alonzo is completely transparent, the game should stop.\n\n\n\nAdd this code to the right place in your script to end the game."

On this page, you’ll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag () is clicked.\n\n\n\n\nIf your project is open and the script is still running, click the red stop sign, . If it isn’t open already, open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project.\n\n\n\n\nClicking the green flag button in the top right corner of the window () starts all scripts that begin with the when green flag clicked hat block. \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a second script that makes Alonzo  a welcome message when the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, “Welcome to ‘Click Alonzo!’ Keep clicking me if you can!”)\n\n\nMake that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.\n\nThe say block with an empty text in the white input slot will make the sprite say nothing.\n\n\n\nCheck that your app does everything you want:\n\n\nWhen the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.\n\n\nWhen Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and get more transparent.\n\n\nAlonzo should start to reappear (but shouldn’t face the other way) any time he moves without being clicked."

You can divide the task among several computers (one for each starting letter). Each computer adds the lengths of all the words assigned to it (all the \"A\" words, all the \"B\" words, etc). Then one computer has to add the 26 partial results and divide by the total number of words to find the average.

So software has to compensate by checking that the machines are running and reassigning the tasks of a failed computer to a working one.</p>\n    <p>Also, when you are doing things in parallel, the parallel processes can interfere with each other.\n        <div class=\"endnote\">\n            <a href=\"#hint-banking\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" title=\"An example of interfering processes with banking...\">An example of interfering processes with banking...</a>\n            <div id=\"hint-banking\" class=\"collapse\">\n                <p>\n                    If one person withdraws money from an ATM at the same time as someone at a different ATM withdraws money from the same account, you could run into a situation like this:\n                    <table class=\"bordered standard nowrap center\" summary=\"Possible sequence of events when two ATM transactions happen in parallel\">\n                    <tr>\n                        <td rowspan=\"9\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; border-left: 0; border-top: 0; border-bottom: 0;\"><img class=\"inline noshadow\" src=\"/img/5-algorithms/time-arrow.png\" alt=\"downward pointing arrow labeled 'time'\" title=\"downward pointing arrow labeled 'time'\" /></td>\n                        <th scope=\"col\">ATM 1</th>\n                        <th scope=\"col\">ATM 2</th>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>looks up the balance ($100)</td>\n                        <td></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>looks up the balance ($100)</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>checks if the amount requested ($40) is available</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>adjusts the balance ($60)</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td></td>\n                        <td>dispenses the money</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>check if the amount requested ($20) is available</td>\n                        <td></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>adjusts the balance ($80)</td>\n                        <td></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>dispenses the money</td>\n                        <td></td>\n                    </tr>\n                </table>\n                </p>\n                <p>Because ATM 2 changed the account balance after ATM 1 looked up the balance, ATM 1 didn't know that the balance had been changed.

Suppose you are combining data from different countries about distances between cities, and you discover that the distance data from the U.S. is measured in miles, but the distance data from Europe is measured in kilometers; to make meaningful comparisons, you need <em>uniform</em> data (all in miles or all in kilometers). As another example, if you use an online survey to collect data, the way participants abbreviate, spell, or capitalize their entries may vary. Data may also be incomplete (if some people didn't complete the survey) or invalid (if some people made mistakes).</p>\n    <div class=\"vocabFullWidth\">\n        <div class=\"comment\">DAT-2.C.4, DAT-2.E.2</div>\n        <p><strong>Cleaning data</strong> is the process of making the data uniform <em>without changing its meaning</em> (such as replacing abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the intended word or converting miles to kilometers).

The conclusion that broccoli prevents cancer could be a result of <em>bias</em>. It could be that people who eat a lot of broccoli tend to be the same people who also get a lot of exercise, and it's actually the exercise that makes the difference. In research, the term \"bias\" doesn't have to mean prejudice; it's about reasons the data might not mean what they seem to mean.</p>\n    <p>People sometimes think that the way to overcome bias is to use a bigger sample (asking more people if they eat broccoli and have cancer).

For example, a music file might contain data describing the song title, artist, album, genre, record label, etc. Or an image file might include data for the date that the picture was taken, the location where it was taken, information about the camera settings, the serial number of the specific camera, etc. This kind of information about data is called <strong>metadata</strong>.  Metadata tell you additional information about the data you are working with and can be used to organize and manage your data. For example, you can use metadata to find all of your photos from a particular time and place or to restrict access to all videos recorded by your old phone. Metadata are connected to but different from your data and can be changed without impacting the primary data. For example, changing the album name of a song won't change what the song sounds like.</p>\n            \n    <p>Because metadata are often not displayed by software, it's easy to violate privacy without realizing it when posting data online...</p>\n    <p class=\"blockquote\">\"...an electronic camera is not just a camera.

A labor of love, no doubt, but a blatant copyright violation as well. He doubtless figured he was just posting the pixels, which could not be traced back to him.

We need to show that there has to be at least one function and one input to that function for which <code>halts?</code> fails to work the way we assumed it does. So, we can make up a block, <code>tester</code>, specifically for the purpose of breaking <code>halts?</code>:<br />\n        <div class=\"sidenoteBig\">\n            Just like the <code>#</code> and <code>⋮</code> symbols for inputs declared to be <em>numbers</em> or <em>lists</em>, the <code>&lambda;</code> is not part of the input's name but is a <strong>type hint</strong> that was created when selecting the <em>reporter</em> input type:<br />  \n            <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/5-algorithms/input-type-reporter.png\" alt=\"selecting the Reporter input type\" title=\"selecting the Reporter input type\"/><br />\n            Recall that selecting an input type changes the appearance of the input slot so that it indicates what kind of input is expected.

If the <code>tester</code> code ends up in this part of the <code>if</code> statement, it will never report anything. So whether <code>tester</code> <em>itself</em> will halt depends on the output of the <code>halts?</code> predicate in the <code>if</code> statement inside it.</p>\n    <p>The expression <img class=\"inline\" src=\"/img/5-algorithms/halts-reporter-reporter.png\" alt=\"halts? (reporter) (reporter)\" title=\"halts? (reporter) (reporter)\" /> asks what will happen if we call the input function (<var>reporter</var>) with <em>itself</em> as its own input.

Stick with it! We are <em>creating a contradiction</em> to prove that the <code>halts?</code> function called inside <code>tester</code> can't exist. \n    </div>\n    \n    <h3><strong>Using Self-Reference to Lead to Contradiction</strong></h3>\n    <p>\n        To make the situation <em>exactly</em> like what Betsy said (\"The statement I'm making <em>right now </em>is false.\"), we'll call <code>tester</code> on <em>itself</em>:<br />\n        <img class=\"indent\" src=\"/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png\" alt=\"tester(tester())\" title=\"tester(tester())\" /><br />\n        Now, the <code>if</code> statement inside the <code>tester</code> block will ask if <code>tester</code> will halt (not run forever) if it's called with <code>tester</code> as its input. The predicate in the <code>if</code> statement will become <code>halts? (tester) (tester)</code>.<br />\n\nI took out class=“indent” on this picture so that it’d fit in the window.

He is known for two achievements. First, he made a massive contribution to winning World War II by inventing a mathematical theory and corresponding computer hardware to break the encoded messages generated by the German Enigma machine. Second, together with his colleague Alonzo Church, Turing was a founder of <em>theoretical computer science</em>: proving how computers <em>must</em> work regardless of future technology. Though his work on the Halting Problem, he proved that <em>there are computations that can never be done</em>, no matter how big and fast computers get.</p>\n        <p>When Turing did this work, there were no programmable computers; people had to rewire physical machines to solve each new problem. With powerful programming languages (such as Snap<em>!</em>), we can see and understand the essence of Turing's proof much more easily because we can use functions as inputs to other functions, as you've seen with <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>. This proof was even harder for Turing because he had to invent the idea of a computer program that can itself be represented as data inside the computer.</p>\n    </div>"

A benefit is that when a war starts, especially if voters feel that their country is under attack, a war makes people feel patriotic, and that is reflected in greater approval of the president. That's the primary effect until American soldiers die. Voters disapprove of American deaths. In the study quoted above, the researchers examined George W. Bush's approval ratings <em>state by state,</em> and found that his rating was measurably lower in states from which more soldiers had died.</p>\n    <p>The risk of American deaths, leading to votes against the president's party, is what keeps presidents from fighting unnecessary wars. It's also why Barack Obama promised \"no American boots on the ground\" in the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n    <p>Drone aircraft are important mainly because they make it easier to start a war in which no Americans die.  The pilots are in the US, not in the country being bombed.

    "text": "Programming a Game\n\n\nOn this page, you’ll build a simple game in which the player tries to click a character that’s jumping around.\n\n\n\n If you’re doing this in class, you should be working with a partner. It’s not just for students; professional programmers work with partners too.\n\nIf each of you is in front of a computer, one of you should keep Snap! open, and the other should keep this lab page open. If you are sharing a computer, use two browser tabs.\n\n\n\nMaking a Character Move\n\n\n\n\nMake sure either you or your partner is logged in to Snap! so you can save your work.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving a Snap! Project\n\n\nChoose “Save” from the Snap! File menu, .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  This is Alonzo, the mascot of our programming language, Snap!. You should see him on the stage, the white area in the top right corner of the Snap! window. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re going to program a game in which the goal is to click on Alonzo as he’s moving around.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a first step, make Alonzo jump someplace else on the stage when he’s clicked. Drag these two blocks into the scripting area (the center area of the window):\n\n\n\nYou can find blocks in palettes with their matching color. Drag one block underneath another to snap them together.\n\n\n \n\nCRD-2.B.1\n\n\nThis is a computer program, also known as software. It’s a very short one, but it’ll get more interesting soon.\n\n\n\nTest your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the stage several times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.\n\n\nIf your program doesn’t work, look back at the picture of the code and make sure yours matches exactly.\n\n\nMake sure the two blocks are attached to each other by moving the when I am clicked block and checking that the go to block moves with it.\n\n\nMake sure that the first block says when I am (clicked) and not something else, and make sure that the second block says go to (random position) and not something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrange boxes contain the ideas you should still remember three years from now.\n\n  \n\nCRD-2.C.2, CRD-2.C.3, CRD-2.C.5\n\n\nBlocks that look like this can be used to detect an event such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap! programmers call them “hat blocks.” Using events to control a program is called event-driven programming.\n\n\nNot every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind when I am (clicked) and when (space) key pressed in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a good idea to save your project every so often.\n\n\n\n\nChoose “Save” from the Snap! File menu, .\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game Challenging\n\n\n\nThe game isn’t much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked. Once you’ve clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says “do this forever.” And there is a block that does it: \n\n\n\n\n\nA bunch of blocks clicked together is called a script.\n\nAttach this to the bottom of your Alonzo script: \n\nThe sequence of blocks inside the forever block will repeat until you click the red stop sign, , or stop the script in some other way.\n\n\nClick for an animation of snapping these two blocks together.\n\n<img class=\"indent\" data-gifffer=\"/img/1-introduction/snap-blocks.gif\" alt=\"animation showing the block go to (position) being snapped inside a forever block\" title=\"animation showing the block go to (position) being snapped inside a forever block\" />\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonzo moves too fast. Use the  block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.\n\nWhere the wait block goes in your script matters. Do you want the script to wait one time or each time Alonzo moves?"

    "text": "Giving the Player Feedback\n\nNow the game is challenging, but players can’t tell how well they’re doing because Alonzo jumps around whether the player clicks him or not. On this page, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.\n\n\nConfirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked\n\n\nFirst, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.\n\n\n: Sprites and Costumes\n\nThe Alonzo character is named after Alonzo Church, a major contributor to early computer science. In this project, there are three objects related to Alonzo:\n\n\nOne is a sprite, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.\n\n\nThe other two are costumes, picture that can be \"worn\" by a sprite.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.   \n\n\nThe project you loaded has two Alonzo costumes—one facing right and the other facing left—so you can use the  block to make the sprite face the other way. Add the next costume block to the place in your program where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.\n\n\nTest your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is clicked but not when he jumps without being clicked.\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Score\n\n\n\nThe player will also want to know how much progress they have made in the game. The command  can control Alonzo’s transparency.\n\n\n\nThe transparency of an image is how much you can see what’s behind it. For example, here is the Alonzo sprite shown with three different transparencies (which have been set using the ghost effect block). \n\n\n\n\nUse transparency to tell the user how close they are to winning: every time they click, Alonzo gets more invisible, and when he disappears completely, they win the game.\n\n\n\n\nDrag the change (ghost) effect block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does. At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible? You can use the command  to make Alonzo fully opaque again.\n\n\nThen, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly. Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game. Try out your game.\n\n\n\n\nMaking the Game More Challenging\n\n\nSo far, even a bad player will eventually make Alonzo disappear. The game will be much more interesting if the player is penalized for missing a click.\n\n\n\n\nFigure out where to add a change (ghost) effect by (-5) block to your script to make Alonzo get less transparent any time he moves without being clicked.\n\n\nPlay your game a few times, and adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.\n\n\nYou can change the change effect input number (for either instance of the block) and/or the wait time to make the game easier or harder.\n\n\n\n\nEnding the Game\n\n\n\nWhen Alonzo is completely transparent, the game should stop.\n\n\n\nAdd this code to the right place in your script to end the game."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Why this? AP talks about the abstraction hierarchy. This page shows some level of detail, but also highlights the two crucial abstraction barriers: between hardware and software, and between the analog domain and the digital domain.\n\n\nWhy here? This page is sort of preview of coming attractions. It’s a short page, with nothing really to do except read it and move on to the full story.\n\n\nPG, on unit: This whole unit is a lot of reading and very little action. Of course, that’s true of most school courses so, for better or for worse, kids are used to it. We’ve thought about it and (currently) have no solution. I very much like all the content. I equally much want the entire unit to be optional extra. To me, it feels like the second course in computer science, not the attract-students-in course. For those who want to see what’s under the hood of the /computer/—the computer engineering interest—this should be available, but if it were not for CB, I’d leave it all optional.\n\n\nBH, on lab: There’s hardly anything to do in this lab, and if we could improve on that it’d be great, but I don’t see how.\n\n\nMF: lightly clean up to make the text more concise\n\n\n\nIn Unit 4 A Hierarchy of Open Protocols, you saw that the Internet software is arranged in several levels of abstraction, with application programs (like your email program) at the highest level and network hardware protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level. Recall that higher levels are closer to what users want to be thinking about; lower levels are closer to the way machines work.\n\n\nLike the Internet, the way a computer works on the inside also has levels of abstraction.\n\n\n\nIn this lab, you will learn about the levels of abstraction in computer software and hardware.\n\n\nOn this page, you will learn get an overview of three groups (domains) of levels of abstraction.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of levels of abstraction in how computers work. Here they are organized into three overarching domains:\n\n\n\nDifferent people might draw this diagram slightly differently, so don’t try to memorize all the levels. The key abstraction levels to remember are software, digital computer hardware, and underlying analog circuit components.\n\n\nDo we need this commented out content? –MF, 6/12/20\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Domain\n\n\nThe programs you write and use are software, but underneath these programs is more software that helps them work. In this lab, we’ll look at four layers of abstraction in the software domain:\n\n\napplications that you write and use\n\n\nprogramming languages that are used to write them\n\n\nlibraries of useful functions that hide messy details\n\n\noperating systems that interface with the hardware\n\n\n\n\nSoftware is an abstraction—a way of thinking about the computer without thinking about how it works.\n\n\nSimilarly, an automobile driver is operating at a high level of abstraction when using the brake pedal. As long as the engineers and mechanics designed and built the car right, drivers don’t need to know the details about how the brake system works—they just use it at a high level.\n\n\n\n\nImage by Wikipedia user Julianprescott2604juuly\n\n\n\nDigital Domain\n\n\nIn the software domain, each level of abstraction is a different piece of software, but the levels of abstraction in the digital domain are different ways of thinking about the same physical object. The circuitry inside a computer is complicated, and to make building it possible, engineers think about it at several different levels of abstraction:\n\n\nThe architecture is the instructions that software can send that the hardware will understand.\n\n\nThe computer has components (such as memory, processors, video cards, etc.) that implement the architecture.\n\n\nThose components are built out of integrated circuits (chips), which are the black rectangles that you can see on this circuit board.\n\n\nThose integrated circuits are designed around logic gates, the fundamental building blocks that implement Boolean functions.\n\n\nYou learned about Boolean functions in Unit 2 Lab 3: Making Decisions by Using Predicates.   \n\n\n\n\nDo we need this commented out content? –MF, 6/12/20\n\n\n\nAnalog Domain\n\n\nLogic gates, which are the lowest abstraction level of the digital domain, operate on ones and zeros. In physical reality, those logic gates are built out of transistors, a type of circuit component. Transistors aren’t like light switches that are either on or off. There can be in-between values (like “only 23% on”). So, electrical engineers have to think about the laws of electronics to design digital circuits so that in-between values don’t happen.\n\n\n: analog vs. digital\n\nDigital and analog are opposites. Digital means information that is represented as ones and zeros. Analog means information that is represented by signals that vary continuously (that is, including in-between values)."

    "text": "MF: lightly clean up to cut down on the boxes\n\n\n\nOn this page, you’ll learn about the transistors that implement logic gates.\n\n\n\nThe transistor is the fundamental building block of electronic circuits, where they are used as on/off switches.\n\n Image by sv.Wikipedia user DaRy \n\n\nYou’ve learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. The reality is more complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, a transistor, or a logic gate output is a simplification—an abstraction.\n\n\n\nThis is a rough graph of the actual input-output behavior of a transistor. Don’t worry about the details; just notice the two blue flat parts of the graph.  Within the “cutoff” region, small changes to the input voltage do not change the output voltage at all; the output is always zero volts. Likewise within the “saturation” region, small input changes hardly impact output voltage; the output is interpreted as a one. This is how transistors are used as switches in a computer.\n\n\nTransistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle, linear (pink) part of the graph, they’re amplifiers; a small variation in input voltage produces a large variation in output voltage. That’s how they’re used to play music in a stereo.\n\n\n\nWhy are they called “cutoff,” “linear,” and “saturation”?\n\nThe lower region of the curve is called “cutoff” because the transistor’s output is cut off (the output is zero) for any input in that region. The upper region is called “saturation” because, like a sponge that can’t get any wetter, the transistor can’t give more output no matter how big the input. The central region is called “linear” because it behaves like a linear (straight) function.\n\n\n\nThe transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix. The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.\n\n\nThe digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off. The digital domain is an abstraction.\n\n\nLearn more about what’s below the digital abstraction and how it’s applied.\n\n\nThe flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there will be small changes in the input. Electrical circuits have “noise,” undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why computers use zeros and ones: a transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.\n\n\nBut the flatness of the saturated region is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is fanout, the number of transistor inputs to which one transistor’s output is connected. Beyond a certain number (it depends on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage is reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they’re getting a zero or a one.\n\n\nThe way a transistor really works depends on quantum physics. (We’re not talking about quantum computers; plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more about analog-domain circuit design and what’s inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch how transistors are used to implement logic gates."

    "text": "Significant changes in new framework: Most of 6.1.2 (the descriptions of categories of software and how creative you can be with them) can go. (from Brian)\n\n\nMF: lightly clean up to make the text more concise\n\n\n\nOn this page, you’ll explore some of the many purposes for which people use software applications.\n\n\nApplication programs (or “apps” for short) are the programs that users interact with. Here are some uses of such software that you may be familiar with:\n\n\nCommunication. You use a browser to view web pages on the World Wide Web. You keep in touch with friends using social networking, email, text messages, and chat applications that can be text-based, audio-based, or video-based. You can also tell the world what you think in a blog (short for weblog) or a vlog (short for video blog).\n\n\nAudio. Your computer or phone almost certainly has an application to play music—either from your own collection or from an Internet radio server. You can also use software to create music by using synthesizers that make new sounds, sampling (reusing) existing sounds, and recording sounds around you. For example, instead of being limited to someone else’s music selections on the radio, apps like Pandora create an individualized radio station just for you.\n\n\nPictures. You likely have a photo viewing application on your own computer or phone. You can also use software to manipulate pictures to create artwork, sharpen the focus, or create “fake news” by combining unrelated images. For example, when you get x-rays, the results are emailed to the doctor right away instead of having to wait for the images to be developed.\n\n\nIt would be great to have a funny picture here—maybe Obama shaking hands with an alien or something obviously fake like this (but not as creepy)… –MF, 11/13/17 Brian wants it to not be political (maybe a rock star or something). I agree. –MF, 12/8/17 \n\n\nVideo. You can use streaming video services to watch movies online, or you can create your own. You can shoot movies on your phone, edit them by combining video from different sources,  and upload them to the Internet or burn them onto a DVD to share them with your friends. Professional movie-making uses computer animation to create special effects like space aliens, armies of soldiers, and super heroes jumping over buildings.\n\n\nYour programs. The projects you’ve been creating in Snap! are apps too!\n\n\n\n\nThere are other kinds of software that aren’t for personal use but are used in industry and universities. Software applications are written to guide rockets, to analyze the results of experiments, and to design buildings and cars. Software is even written to write software.\n\n\nThe amount of information available on the Internet is huge. Computers can learn to combine information from different sources, to produce surprising results. This is called data mining. For example, businesses can combine location information from your phone with similar information from other phones to find traffic jams or popular restaurants. Or they can combine multiple sources of online information about you to send you targeted advertising for products you’re likely to want or to keep track of your political views for voter registration drives.\n\n\nComputers can be taught to generalize from the information they find to patterns they can use to predict the future. This is called machine learning. For example, scientists teach computers to explore telescope observations to learn new things about how the physical universe works.\n\n\nYou can use spreadsheets to manage your budget or to make charts and tables. Spreadsheets are a computer implementation of what was previously a pencil-and-paper process; they are the application that made businesses take personal computers seriously.\n\n\n\n\nAs new kinds of hardware are invented, new kinds of software become important. For example, the invention of the smartphone, which is always with its owner, has enabled applications such as song identification: you hear a song you like that you haven’t heard before so you hold your phone up, and it samples the sound and finds it in a song database. Because our phones are almost always on, they can collect information about where you are. This can be desirable when you look for friends who have agreed to share location information with you, but it also may allow your employer to find out that you took part in a political demonstration for or against civil rights.\n\n\n\n\nList three programs for each of the following categories:\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nPictures\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nYour Snap! projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich popular composers use sampling for their songs?\n\n\nWhat is autotune and which popular artists use it?\n\n\nWhat kinds of photo processing can you do with software? What kinds have you done?"

    "text": "KEEP SUCH THAT needs to be fixed. –MF, 6/22/20\n\n\n\nThis page is getting long. After we finish going through the standards, we should consider how much of this is really needed. –MF, 1/29/19\n\n\nAlso, is this a page where we might want to make any of the “not a baby language” argument? –MF, 1/29/19\n\n\nMF: lightly clean up to make the text more concise\n\n\n\nOn this page, you will consider why there are different programming languages and look at some of the ways that languages differ.\n\n\nJavaScript, Python, Snap!, C++, Java, Scheme, Prolog… Why are there so many programming languages? Why don’t we just pick the best one, or design a new best one, and stick with that?\n\n\nSome languages have very narrow purposes; these are called special-purpose languages. For example, Microsoft Word has a programming language built into it called “Word macros” that’s just for generating data and formatting in a document. Likewise, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is just for structuring web pages.\n\n\nGeneral-purpose languages don’t have a narrow purpose in mind. In a sense, these languages are all the same: if an algorithm can be expressed in one language, it can be expressed in all of them. Several basic features are included in nearly all languages including arithmetic operators (+, -, ×, ÷) and Boolean operators (and, or, not). The differences among languages are mostly about levels of abstraction.\n\n\nHigh-Level and Low-Level Languages\n\n\n\nA high-level language (like Snap! or Scheme) includes many built-in abstractions that make it easier to focus on the problem you want to solve rather than on how computer hardware works. A low-level language (like C) has fewer abstractions, requiring you to know a lot about your computer’s architecture to write a program.\n\n\nWhy do programmers use high-level languages?\n\n\nHigh-level languages can produce safer programs—ones that are less likely to have bugs—because the abstractions manage messy details that can trip up programmers.\n\n\n\nHigh-level languages reduce bugs in memory use. Older, low-level languages required the programmer to manage the use of the computer’s memory with instructions saying “get me a block of memory big enough to hold 100 numbers” and other instructions saying “okay, I’m finished using this block of memory; it can be allocated for some other purpose.”\n\n\nThis is a nuisance to have to think about, and human programmers are bad at it. In low level languages, a very common bug is for one part of a program to say “I’m done with this block of memory” while another part of the program is still using it. High-level languages take care of this for us by using a technique called garbage collection that puts the computer in charge of knowing when a block of memory is no longer in use.\n\n\n\nHigh-level languages can also make programming much more convenient because they offer more abstractions. One example is higher-order functions (like map, keep, combine, and for each), which allow the programmer to write shorter, cleaner code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code is similar to a higher-order procedure that you have learned.  Identify the procedure that this code imitates: \n\n\n\nYou learned about for each in Unit 2 Lab 2: Checking Each Quiz Answer.\n\n\nYou learned about keep in Unit 2 Lab 3: Keeping Items from a List.\n\n\nYou learned about map in Unit 3 Lab 2: Transforming Every List Item.\n\n\nYou learned about combine in Unit 2 Lab 4: Other Mathematical Reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the original script report a list of words or does it report each word separately? Which would this do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep takes a predicate (a question) as input and reports a list of the items that make that predicate true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine takes a predicate with two blanks (like  or ) as input and reports the result of combining all the list items using that function (for example, adding them all together or joining them all into one text string).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn C, you can do this the long way:  but C doesn’t let you take an expression (like  or ) and stick it into a higher-order function like map: \n\n\nWhy do programmers use low-level languages?\n\n\nThe best reason to use low-level languages is to write operating systems (like Windows, Mac OS X, Android, or iOS). You’ll learn more about Operating systems on the The Software Domain: Operating Systems page.\n\n\nWhy else would a programmer use a low-level language?\n\n\nI still think this is too long and needs wordsmithing the next time around. –MF, 11/16/17\n\n\nApplication programmers don’t often decide “I’m going to write this program in a low level language.” They may simply not realize that higher levels of abstraction are possible. For example, a computer’s hardware limits the size of numbers that its arithmetic unit can add in a single step. Four billion—about ten digits—is a common size limit for integers. Programmers who use Java, JavaScript, Python, C or C++ may think that this limit is unavoidable. But programmers who use really high level languages, such as Scheme or Common Lisp, know that they can do arithmetic on numbers with millions or billions of digits, limited only by the size of the computer’s memory. As you will see later, Snap! has a library that lets it do this, too.\n\n\nPeople often say that different programming languages are good for different kinds of programs, but except for 3-D video processing (next paragraph), it’s hard to imagine an application that would be harmed by things like garbage collection or higher-order functions. There are just a few cases in which people deliberately design languages with features that might not be wanted for some applications. Here’s one such example: In Snap!, a text string of only digits is considered to be a number; you can do arithmetic on it. In a language for learners, requiring explicit conversion between data types just makes it harder to get started programming. But most languages that aren’t meant for beginners keep the two data types separate.\n\n\nProgrammers may think that abstraction is too slow. This used to be true, and programmers of 3-D video games still need all the speed they can get because their programs strain the speed of modern computers. So they often write part of their programs, the part that actually puts pictures on the screen, in machine language, just for speed. But most programmers write applications that don’t strain computers at all. When you send an email or text message, the limiting factor is how fast you can type, not how fast your computer can run programs.\n\n\nFrom Michael: Somewhere the was a comment about the speed of abstraction. IMO, we shouldn’t have this in the curriculum – but probably in the teachers guide. “Abstraction slows things down” is an argument students won’t hear if they’re just learning CS from BJC. By trying to address the argument before it happens, we just introduced to students who I think would have no reason to believe otherwise.\n\n\nBrian thinks that Michael would not have this concern if the link was still, “There are also less-good reasons.” However, Mary and Paul find that text problematic. Brian and Mary agreed to record and ignore this issue for now. –MF, 11/21/17\n\n\n\n\nLegacy code. Programmers in industry hardly ever get to write a program from the beginning. Much more often, they’re maintaining a program that somebody wrote years ago, and that person might not even work for that company anymore. In the long run, it might be better to rewrite the program in a more modern language, but in the short run, there’s no time to do that so they end up modifying the existing code in the existing programming language.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is machine language?\n\n\nBoth high- and low-level languages are used by people to write computer programs. Computer hardware understands a sort of ultra-low-level language, called machine language. Special programs called compilers and interpreters are used to translate human programming languages into machine language to be run by the computer.\n\n\nRead more about compilers and interpreters.\n\n\nA compiler is a program that takes a high- or low-level language program (the source code) as input and produces a machine language program (the object code) as its output. Once produced, the machine language program can be run repeatedly without needing to be compiled again.\n\n\nAn interpreter is a program that takes a high- or low-level program as input and carries out machine language instructions as needed to run the program. It does not produce a stand-alone machine language program as output and will have to repeat the process again next time.\n\n\nDoes that mean compilers are better?\n\n\nIt would mean that, except that the process of writing a program includes debugging. During the debugging, an interpreter can help by providing information about the progress of the program, like the visual stepping feature in Snap!, and allowing small changes in the source program without having to run a compiler repeatedly. For example, in Snap! you can drag a block into a script while it’s running, and a compiler couldn’t allow that.\n\n\nFor professional programmers, the best arrangement is to have both an interpreter and a compiler for the same language. The programmer writes and debugs the program using an interpreter, and once they’re sure it works, they compile it. Then, the compiler can run slowly, putting a lot of effort into optimizing the machine language code, so they get the fastest possible compiled program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese questions are similar to those you will see on the AP CSP exam. \n\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct about a low-level programming language compared with a high-level programming language?\n\n\nLow-level language programs are generally harder for people to understand than programs written in a high-level language.\n\n\nA low-level language provides programmers with more abstractions than a high-level language.\n\n\nLow-level language programs are generally harder to debug than programs written in a high-level language.\n\n\n\n\n\nI only.\n\n\nI is true but is it the only true statement?\n\n\n\n\nI and III only.\n\n\nCorrect. Both statements are correct and opposite of II is true as high-level languages are more expressive and able in creating abstractions.\n\n\n\n\nII and III only.\n\n\nOpposite of II is true as high-level languages are more expressive and able in creating abstractions.\n\n\n\n\nI, II, and III.\n\n\nOpposite of II is true as high-level languages are more expressive and able in creating abstractions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA program is written in a high-level programming language. Identify the correct statement about the program?\n\n\n\nThe program can also be written in machine language using binary code, but then it will be less easily understood by people.\n\n\nCorrect. Binary code is very hard to read for humans.\n\n\n\n\nThe program can also be written in machine language using binary code, which will decrease the possibility of mistakes.\n\n\nMistakes will likely increase as it is harder for humans to make sense of binary code.\n\n\n\n\nThe program cannot be written in binary code as only data can be represented by using binary notation.\n\n\nEntire program can be converted to binary code. Such a code is actually the only code a machine can understand.\n\n\n\n\nSimple parts of the program can be written in binary code, but control elements such as conditionals, loops must be expressed in a high-level programming language.\n\n\nEntire program can be converted to binary code. Such a code is actually the only code a machine can understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Readability\n\n\nOne of the features that Snap! gives you is that you can put title text in the middle of a block.\n\nYou built polygon in Unit 1: Graphics and Art.\n\n Compared to some other languages where the function has one name at the beginning and then all the inputs, this increases clarity and readability of your function.\n\npolygon(30, 15)\n\n\n\nAlso, in a text-based language, when you see something like 3 × 5 + 4, you need to have memorized that multiplication comes before addition (so the answer is 19). If you want it the other way, you have to use parentheses: 3 × (5 + 4) to get 27. In a blocks-based language, the blocks show you what was intended: . You’ve learned order of operations for +, –, ×, and ÷ in math class, but you probably haven’t learned order of operations for an expression like this:\nx && y << z\n. How you know which comes first\n&&\nor\n<<\n?\n\n\nHow do you know?\n\n\nSee for example, C Operator Precedence.\n\n\n\n\nParallelism\n\n\n5.2.1H A process may execute on one or several CPUs.\n\n\nOne reason to create new programming languages is to make it easier to write parallel programs—programs that can use more than one processor at the same time. Today in 2017, computers and smartphones have multicore processor chips that may include 2, 4, or 8 processors all running code at the same time. (The number of processors will increase even further over time.) Big companies such as Google use parallelism even more; they have clusters of thousands of computers, all working on the same program.\n\n\n4.1.2D Different languages are better suited for expressing different algorithms.4.1.2E Some programming languages are designed for specific domains and are better for expressing algorithms in those domains.\n\n\nFunctional programming languages (languages in which programmers never change the value of a variable) are particularly well suited to parallelism because there’s no danger of one processor changing the value of a variable that another processor is using. We’ve introduced you to functional programming techniques wherever possible throughout this course, including writing reporters and using higher-order functions (map, keep, and combine).\n\n\nSnap! isn’t a functional programming language, but it would be if the Snap! developers removed just a few procedures, including set (instead, you’d use input variables of recursive functions) and these four list commands: add, delete, insert, and replace (instead, you’d use in front of, item 1 of, and all but first of to report a new list with different values instead of changing the old list)."

The sprite abstraction lets a programmer move a picture over other pictures without thinking about what happens where the images overlap or how to get back parts of the image after they are covered up. Not all languages have the sprite abstraction.\n\n\nOther common tasks (such as knowing where the mouse pointer is, doing arithmetic on huge numbers, or managing sound) also have complex parts.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On this page, you’ll learn about the software that directly manages the computer’s hardware, the operating system.\n\n\nYour computer came with an operating system (OS) installed. Operating systems are the underlying programs that your apps interact with to communicate with the computer. For computers with keyboards, it’s probably Linux, macOS, or Windows. For phones and tablets, it’s probably Android or iOS.\n\n\nRoughly speaking, the operating system handles the basic tasks that your applications depend on, including:\n\n\nthe window system, which allows more than one window to be open on your screen\n\n\nthe file manager, that displays the contents of folders and lets you select files to read or manipulate\n\n\ncommunications with external devices like your keyboard or printer\n\n\nutilities such as a simple text editor or a calculator\n\n\n\n\nIn a computer, there are many applications and operating system tasks all wanting to run at once. Every operating system has a kernel that manages when all these processes run.\n\n\n\nThe Kernel\n\n\nThe kernel deals directly with hardware (keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera, hard drives, memory, printer, speakers, screen, etc.). So the kernel is generally written in a low level language so it can control that hardware. It handles several important tasks:\n\n\nScheduling. The kernel has access to the time clock that’s built into the hardware and lets each program run for a small amount of time (typically about 1/10 second) and then switches to the next program in line.\n\n\nSecurity. Those many application programs may have bugs or malicious code. The kernel, which has access to the memory where programs and data are stored, ensures that each program is assigned a separate location in memory and doesn’t interfere with other programs. The kernel also controls which data files a program can use based on file protection settings that users or applications specify for each file.\n\n\nInput and output. Many devices can be attached to your computer. The kernel knows how the computer’s hardware reads or writes to each device. Only the kernel is allowed direct access to these devices, and it carries out authorized transfers of information for the applications.\n\n\n\n\nThese days, OS kernels are remarkably similar. Of the five systems listed earlier (Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, and iOS), four of them (all but Windows) are based on variants of a single kernel, called Unix.\n\n\nRead more about Unix.\n\n\n\nThis still needs editing. If we find a way to cut this back, more students will actually read it. –MF, 11/8/17\n\n\n(“Unix” is a trademark, currently owned by The Open Group, and not all of the variants discussed here are authorized to use that name, but they all provide essentially the same program interface.) Unix was created around 1970 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Laboratories.\n\n\nPrior to Unix, almost everyone thought that an operating system had to be developed for a particular computer architecture, and had to be written in the machine language of that computer, the very low-level instructions that the hardware understands directly. The first version of Unix was also written in the machine language of a particular computer, the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7. But the Unix developers knew that the PDP-7 wasn’t the only computer in the world, and better ones would come along, so they wanted to make Unix portable, meaning that it could be brought to a new computer architecture without a complete rewrite. So in 1972 Dennis Ritchie invented the C programming language for that purpose. C is similar to other languages available at the time, but with one added feature: a C programmer can read or write any individual byte of the program’s memory by knowing its address, a number that distinguishes it from other bytes. (You can see that this feature is quite the opposite from high level abstraction. It is useful only to a programmer who’s thinking in detail about what’s where in the computer’s memory.) Unix was then rewritten in C.\n\n\nBecause of its portability, Unix spread quickly to many computer architectures. Researchers at Berkeley developed a version, based on the AT&T version, with virtual memory, the ability to run a program that’s only partly in the computer’s main memory, with the rest kept on a disk. This Berkeley version is an ancestor of Apple’s operating systems, macOS (since macOS 10.0) and iOS. (An Apple computer doesn’t behave anything like a Unix computer, but the differences are almost all in application-level programs, not in the kernel.) Android, Google’s operating system for cell phones and tablets, is based on Linux, a complete rewrite of Unix originally written by Linus Torvalds, who was, at the time, a computer science student in Finland.\n\n\nThe application-level programs that were part of the original Unix package have, in most systems, been replaced with rewritten programs from the Free Software Foundation’s GNU (an acronym for Gnu’s Not Unix) package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the programs running on your computer right now.\n\n\nFind out how to list all the programs that are running right now on your computer, and collect such a program list in a text file.\n\n\nCount how many of them are programs you asked the computer to run.\n\n\nOf the rest, can you figure out from the names what they do?\n\n\nWhich ones are part of the operating system (not the OS kernel)?\n\n\nSee if you can figure out the purpose of some oddly-named ones by doing a web search."

Just as there are layers of abstraction for software, hardware designers also think in layers of abstraction.\n\n\n\nEveryone talks about computers representing all data using only two values, 0 and 1. But that’s not really how electronic circuits work. Computer designers can work as if circuits were either off (0) or on (1) because of the digital abstraction, the most important abstraction in hardware. Above that level of abstraction, there are four more detailed levels, called the digital domain. Below the digital abstraction, designers work in the analog domain, in which a wire in a circuit can have any voltage value, not just two values.\n\n\nOn the next four pages, we’ll explore four levels of the digital domain.\n\n\n\nThe Stored Program Computer\n\n\nAs you’ll see in Lab 2, there have been machines to carry out computations for thousands of years. But the modern, programmable computer had its roots in the work of Charles Babbage in the early 1800s.\n\n\nBabbage was mainly a mathematician, but he contributed to fields as varied as astronomy and economics. Babbage lived about 150 years ago from 1791-1871. Electricity as a source of energy was unknown. The steam engine came into widespread use around the time he was born. The most precise machinery of his time was clockwork—gears.\n\n\nDifference Engine\n\n\nBabbage’s first computer was the Difference Engine. He used gears to design a complex machine that would compute and print tables of numbers (like the tables of log or trig functions you may have in the back of a math textbook). But these gears needed to be so precise that each one had to be handmade. The project became so expensive that the government stopped funding it, and Babbage never finished a full-scale version.\n\n\nBad Mary. ;) We need a CSS solution for this instead of using tables. –MF, 12/4/17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n |  | The Difference Engine at the London Science Museum  | A closeup showing the gears more clearly\nImage by Wikimedia user geni.

License: CC-BY-SA-2.5.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about the history of the Difference Engine.\n\n\nIn Babbage’s time, such numerical tables were computed by hand by human mathematicians, and they were typeset by hand for printing. Both the computation and the copying into type were error-prone, and accurate tables were needed for purposes ranging from engineering to navigation.\n\n\nBabbage built a first, small Difference Engine in 1822. This first effort proved that a Difference Engine was possible, but it didn’t have the precision (number of digits in each number) to be practical. In 1823, the British government funded Babbage to build a larger version. Unfortunately, metalsmiths in his day could not produce very precise gears in large quantities; each one had to be handmade. So he spent ten times his approved budget by the time the government canceled the project in 1842.\n\n\nIn 1991, the London Science Museum completed a Difference Engine following Babbage’s original design using gears made by modern processes but at the level of precision that was available to Babbage. This proved that, in principle, Babbage could have completed a working machine, given enough time and money.\n\n\n\n\nThe Analytical Engine\n\n\nThe Difference Engine could be used to compute many different functions by manually setting the starting position of various gears. But it had only one algorithm: the one built into the hardware design. In 1833, Babbage began working on the Analytical Engine, which was based on the general idea of the Difference Engine but could carry out instructions in a primitive programming language prepared on punched cards.\n\nPunched cards used to program the Analytical Engine Karoly Lorentey. Copyright 2004. License: CC-BY.\n\n\n\n\nThese days, we are surrounded by programmable computers, and having software seems obvious now. But it wasn’t obvious, and before Babbage, all algorithms were implemented directly in hardware.\n\n\nSo, 150 years ago, Babbage created plans for what is essentially a modern computer, although he didn’t have electronics available. His underlying idea for hardware was entirely mechanical, but it turned out not to be possible for him to build it with then-current technology. We didn’t get usable computers until there was an underlying technology small enough, inexpensive enough, and fast enough to support the software abstraction. You’ll learn about this technology, transistors, soon.\n\n\nLearn more about the Analytical Engine.\n\n\nThe Analytical Engine, like modern computers, had an arithmetic processor (called the “mill”) and a separate memory (the “store”) that would hold 1,000 numbers, each with up to 40 digits.  The mill did arithmetic in decimal (with digits 0-9 equally spaced around each gear); using just “ones and zeros” in computing came later.\n\n\nThe programming language used in the Analytical Engine included conditionals and looping, which is all you need to represent any algorithm. (It could loop because it could move forward or backward through the punched cards containing the program.)\n\n\nAlas, Babbage could build only a small part of the Analytical Engine, which would have required even more metalworking than the Difference Engine. His notes about the design weren’t complete, and so nobody has ever built a working model, although there are simulations available on the Web (see the Take It Further problem below). Sadly, in the early days of electronic computers, Babbage’s work was not widely known, and people ended up reinventing many of his ideas.\n\n\n\n\nLearn about Ada, Countess Lovelace’s invention of symbolic computing.\n\n\nAlthough his design was very versatile, Babbage was mainly interested in printing tables of numbers. It was his collaborator Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace, who first recognized that the numbers in Babbage’s computer could be used not only as quantities but also as representing musical notes, text characters, and so on.\n\n\n\nImage by Alfred Edward Chalon, Science & Society Picture Library, Public Domain, via Wikimedia.\n\n\nMuch of what we know today about Babbage’s design comes from Ada Lovelace’s extensive notes on his design. Her notes included the first published program for the Analytical Engine, and so she is widely considered “the first programmer,” although it’s almost certain that Babbage himself wrote several example programs while designing the machine.\n\n\nWhether or not she was truly the first programmer, historians agree that she did something more important: she invented the idea of symbolic computation (including text, pictures, music, etc.) as opposed to numeric computation. This insight paved the way for all the ways that computers are used today, from movies on demand to voice-interactive programs such as Siri and Alexa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abstraction of software (a program stored in the computer’s memory) is what makes a computer usable for more than one purpose.\n\n\nWhat’s an Architecture?\n\n\nThe Analytical Engine (described above) was the first programmable computer architecture. The processor in the computer you are using today understands only one language, its own machine language—not Java, not C, not Snap!, not Python, nor anything else. Programs written in those other languages must first be translated into machine language.\n\n\nThe most important part of the architecture is the machine language, the set of ultra-low-level instructions that the hardware understands. This language is like a contract between the hardware and the software: The hardware promises to understand a set of instructions, and the software compiles programs from human-friendly language into those instructions.\n\n\n\nMachine language is the lowest-level programming language; it is directly understood by the computer hardware.\n\n\nArchitecture is an abstraction, a specification of the machine language. It also tells how the processor connects to the memory. It doesn’t specify the circuitry; the same architecture can be built as circuitry in many different ways.\n\n\n\nOne important part of an architecture is the number of wires that connect the processor and memory. This is called the width of the architecture, measured in bits (number of wires). A wider computer can process more data in one instruction.\n\n\nWhat does machine language look like?\n\n\nConsider the Snap! instruction . In a lower-level language such as C or Java, the same idea would be written as:\nc = a+b;\nThat simple command might be translated into six machine language instructions (slightly simplified here):\nmovq    _c, %rcx\nmovq    _b, %rdx\nmovq    _a, %rsi\nmovl    (%rsi), %edi\naddl    (%rdx), %edi\nmovl    %edi, (%rcx)\nThis notation, called assembly language, is a line-by-line equivalent to the actual numeric instruction codes but is slightly more readable.\n\nWhat does that code mean?\n\n\nThe first three instructions load the addresses of the three variables into registers inside the processor. The names with percent signs, such as %rcx, refer to specific processor registers. Movq is the name of a machine language instruction. (It abbreviates “move quote,” which says to move a constant value into a register. Note that a is a variable, but the address of a is a constant value — the variable doesn’t move around in the computer’s memory.)\n\n\nThe next instruction, movl (“move long”), says to move a word from one place to another. Putting a register name in parentheses, like (%rsi), means to use the memory location whose address is in the register. In this case, since the third movq put the address of a into register %rsi, the first movl says to move the variable a from memory into a processor register. Then the addl instruction says to add the variable b into that same register. Finally, the value in register %edi is moved into the memory location containing variable c.\n\n\n\nYou wouldn’t want to have to program in this language! And you don’t have to; modern architectures are designed for compilers, not for human machine language programmers.\n\n\n\n\nLearn about:\n\n\nPC/Mac architecture\n\n\nThis has a lot of numbers in it which make it harder to read, but more importantly it’s so abstract and doesn’t really talk about anything familiar, which given the hint title “PC/Mac” I was expecting. Needs some work. –MF, 11/8/17\n\n\nMost computer processors (the part that carries out instructions) in desktop or laptop computers use an architecture called “x86” that was designed at Intel, a chip manufacturer. The first processor using that architecture was called the 8086, released in 1978. (The reason for the name x86 is that the first few improved versions were called 80286, 80486, and so on.) The original 8086 was a 16-bit architecture; since then 32-bit (since 1985) and 64-bit (since 2003) versions have been developed. Even with all the refinements of the architecture, the new x86 processors are almost always backward compatible, meaning that today’s versions will still run programs that were written for the original 8086.\n\n\nWhy did the x86 architecture come to rule the world? The short answer is that IBM used it in their original PC, and all the later PC manufacturers followed their lead because they could run IBM-compatible software unmodified. But why did IBM choose the x86? There were arguably better competing architectures available, such as the Motorola 68000 and IBM’s own 801. The PC designers argued about which to use, but in the end, what made the difference was IBM’s long history of working with Intel.\n\n\nThe Apple Macintosh originally used the Motorola 68000 architecture, and in 1994 Apple designed its own PowerPC architecture in a joint project with IBM and Motorola, but in 2006 they, too, switched to the x86, because Intel keeps producing newer, faster versions of the x86 more often than other companies could keep up.\n\n\n\n\nsmartphone architecture\n\n\nEverything about smartphone architecture is determined by the tiny size of the space inside the case. The height and width of the phone are constrained by the size of people’s front pockets. (Don’t keep your phone in your back pants pocket. That’s really bad both for the phone and for your back.) The front-to-back depth of a phone could be much bigger than it is, but for some reason phone manufacturers compete on the thinness of their phones, which gives designers even less room inside.\n\n\nAs a result, many components that would be separate from the processor chip in a computer are instead part of the same chip in a phone. These components may include some or all of a cellular modem, a WiFi modem, a graphics processor (another processor that specializes in parallel arithmetic on lists of numbers), memory, a GPS receiver to find your phone’s physical location, circuitry to manage the power depletion and recharging of the battery, and more. These days, the chip is likely to include two, four, or even eight copies of the actual CPU, to make multicore systems. This collection of components is called a system on a chip, or SoC.\n\n\nIntel made an x86-based (that is, the same architecture used in PCs) low-power SoC called the Atom, which was used in a few Motorola phones and some others made by companies you’ve never heard of. It was made to support Android, Linux, and Windows phones.\n\n\nBut the vast majority of phones use the ARM architecture, which (unlike the x86) was designed from the beginning to be a low-power architecture. The acronym stands for Advanced RISC Machine. It’s available in 32-bit and 64-bit configurations.\n\n\nWhat’s a RISC?\n\n\nThe name stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer, as opposed to the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architectures, including the x86. The instruction set of an architecture is, as you’d guess from the name, the set of instructions that the processor understands. A RISC has fewer instructions than a CISC, but it’s simpler in other ways also. For example, a CISC typically has more addressing modes in its instructions. In the x86 architecture, the add instruction can add two processor registers, or a register and a value from the computer’s memory, or a constant value built into the instruction itself. A RISC architecture’s add instruction just knows how to add two registers (perhaps putting the result into a third register), and there are separate load and store instructions that copy values from memory to register or the other way around. Also, in a RISC architecture, all instructions are the same length (say, 32 bits) whereas in a CISC architecture, instruction lengths may vary. These differences matter because a RISC can be loading the next instruction before it’s finished with the previous instruction, and a RISC never has more than one memory data reference per instruction.\n\n\nSo why don’t they use a RISC architecture in PCs? At one time Apple used a RISC processor called the PowerPC in its Macintosh computers, but the vast majority of computers sold are PCs, not Macs, and as a result Intel spends vast sums of money on building faster and faster circuits implementing the x86 architecture. The moral is about the interaction between different levels of abstraction: A better architecture can be overcome by a better circuit design or better technology to cram components into an integrated circuit.\n\n\n\n\nThe company that designed the ARM, called ARM Holdings, doesn’t actually build processors. They license either the architecture design or an actual circuit design to other companies that integrate ARM processors into SoCs. Major companies that build ARM-based processor chips include Apple, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Samsung. Smartphone manufacturers buy chips from one of these companies.\n\n\n\n\nembedded architecture and the “Internet of Things”\n\n\nYou can buy thermostats with computers in them, refrigerators with computers in them, fuzzy animal toys with computers in them—more and more things, as time goes on. Modern automobiles have several computers in them, largely for safety reasons; you wouldn’t want the brakes to fail because the DVD player has a problem. The goal, as described by researchers in computing, is “smart dust,” meaning that lots of computers could be floating around a building unnoticed. What good is an unnoticed computer? This is a classic dual use technology. The beneficial use everyone talks about is emergency response to disasters; it would be a great help to the fire department to know, from the outside, which rooms of a building have people in them. But another use for this technology would be spying.\n\n\n NXP Freescale SCM-i.MX6D chip\n\n\nFor embedded computing, the main design criteria are small size and low power consumption. The chip in the picture above is based on the ARM architecture, like most cell phones. That’s actually a big embedded-systems chip; the Kinetis KL02 MCU (micro controller unit) fits in a 2 millimeter square—less than 1/10 inch. That’s still too big to float in the air like dust, but imagine it in a sticky container and thrown onto the wall.\n\n\nSomeday, the spying will be even more effective (along with, we hope, treatment for diseases of the brain): ARM targets your brain with new implantable chips (Engadget, 5/17/2017).\n\n\nIntel made a button-sized x86-compatible chip in 2015, but announced in 2017 that it would be discontinued, leaving only ARM and PowerPC-based processors competing in this market.\n\n\n\n\nhobbyist computer architecture\n\n\nIn one sense, any architecture can be a hobbyist architecture. Even back in the days of million-dollar computers, there were software hobbyists who found ways to get into college computer labs, often by making themselves useful there. Today, there are much more powerful computers that are cheap enough that hobbyists are willing to take them apart. But there are a few computer architectures specifically intended for use by hobbyists.\n\n\nWe DO NOT yet have permissions for this image. –MF, 12/4/17\n\n\n\nBy far the most popular computer specifically for hobbyists is the Arduino. It’s a circuit board, not just a processor. Around the edges of the board are connectors. On the short edge on the left in the picture are the power input, which can connect to a power supply plugged into the wall or to a battery pack for a mobile device such as a robot, and a USB connector used mainly to download programs from a desktop or laptop computer. On the long edges are connectors for single wires connected to remote sensors (for light, heat, being near a wall, touching another object, etc.) or actuators (stepping motors, lights, buzzers, etc.).\n\n\nOne important aspect of the Arduino design is that it’s free (“free as in freedom”). Anyone can make and even sell copies of the Arduino. This is good because it keeps the price down (the basic Arduino Uno board costs $22) and encourages innovation, but it also means that there can be incompatible Arduino-like boards. (The name “Arduino” is a trademark that can be used only by license from Arduino AG.)\n\n\nThe processor in most Arduino models is an eight-bit RISC system with memory included in the chip, called the AVR, from a company called Atmel. It was designed by two (then) students in Norway, named Alf-Egil Bogen and Vegard Wollan. Although officially “AVR” doesn’t stand for anything, it is widely believed to come from “Alf and Vegard’s RISC.” There are various versions of the AVR processor, with different speeds, memory capacities, and of course prices; there are various Arduino models using the different processors.\n\n\nUnlike most (“von Neumann architecture”) computers, the AVR (“Harvard architecture”) separates program memory from data memory. (It actually has three kinds of memory, one for the running program, one for short-term data, and one for long-term data.) Babbage’s Analytical Engine was also designed with a program memory separate from its data memory.\n\n\nWhy would you want more than one kind of memory?\n\n\nThere are actually two different design issues at work in this architecture. One is all the way down in the analog domain, having to do with the kind of physical circuitry used. There are many memory technologies, varying in cost, speed, and volatility: volatile memory loses the information stored in it when the device is powered off, while non-volatile memory retains the information. Here’s how memory is used in the AVR chips:\n\n\nEEPROM (512 Bytes–4kBytes) is non-volatile, and is used for very long term data, like a file in a computer’s disk, except that there is only a tiny amount available. Programs on the Arduino have to ask explicitly to use this memory, with an EEPROM library.\n\n\nThe name stands for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, which sounds like a contradiction in terms. In the early days of transistor-based computers, there were two kinds of memory, volatile (Random Access Memory, or RAM) and nonvolatile (Read-Only Memory, or ROM). The values stored in an early ROM had to be built in by the manufacturer of the memory chip, so it was expensive to have a new one made. Then came Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM), which was read-only once installed in a computer, but could be programmed, once only, using a machine that was only somewhat expensive. Then came EPROM, Erasable PROM, which could be erased in its entirety by shining a bright ultraviolet light on it, and then reprogrammed like a PROM. Finally there was Electrically Erasable PROM, which could be erased while installed in a computer, so essentially equivalent to RAM, except that the erasing is much slower than rewriting a word of RAM, so you use it only for values that aren’t going to change often.\n\n\n\n\nSRAM (1k–4kBytes): This memory can lose its value when the machine is turned off; in other words, it’s volatile. It is used for temporary data, like the script variables in a Snap! script.\n\n\nThe name stands for Static Random Access Memory. The “Random Access” part differentiates it from the magnetic tape storage used on very old computers, in which it took a long time to get from one end of the tape to another, so it was only practical to write or read data in sequence. Today all computer memory is random access, and the name “RAM” really means “writable,” as opposed to read-only. The “Static” part of the name means that, even though the memory requires power to retain its value, it doesn’t require periodic refreshing as regular (“Dynamic”) computer main memory does. (“Refreshing” means that every so often, the computer has to read the value of each word of memory and rewrite the same value, or else it fades away. This is a good example of computer circuitry whose job is to maintain the digital abstraction, in which a value is zero or one, and there’s no such thing as “fading” or “in-between values.”) Static RAM is faster but more expensive than dynamic RAM; that’s why DRAM is used for the very large (several gigabytes) memories of desktop or laptop computers.\n\n\n\n\nFlash memory (16k–256kBytes): This is the main memory used for programs and data. Flash memory is probably familiar to you because it’s used for the USB sticks that function as portable external file storage. It’s technically a kind of EEPROM, but with a different physical implementation that makes it much cheaper (so there can be more of it in the Arduino), but more complicated to use, requiring special control circuitry to maintain the digital abstraction.\n\n\n“More complicated” means, for example, that changing a bit value from 1 to 0 is easy, but changing it from 0 to 1 is a much slower process that involves erasing a large block of memory to all 1 bits and then rewriting the values of the bits you didn’t want to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, that’s why there are physically different kinds of memory in the AVR chips, but none of that completely explains the Harvard architecture, in which memory is divided into program and data, regardless of how long the data must survive. The main reason to have two different memory interface circuits is that it allows the processor to read a program instruction and a data value at the same time. This can in principle make the processor twice as fast, although that much speed gain isn’t found in practice.\n\n\nTo understand the benefit of simultaneous instruction and data reading, you have to understand that processors are often designed using an idea called pipelining. The standard metaphor is about doing your laundry, when you have more than one load. You wash the first load, while your dryer does nothing; then you wash the second load while drying the first load, and so on until the last load. Similarly, the processor in a computer includes circuitry to decode an instruction, and circuitry to do arithmetic. If the processor does one thing at a time, then at any moment either the instruction decoding circuitry or the arithmetic circuitry is doing nothing. But if you can read the next instruction at the same time as carrying out the previous one, all of the processor is kept busy.\n\n\nThis was a long explanation, but it’s still vastly oversimplified. For one thing, it’s possible to use pipelining in a von Neumann architecture also. And for another, a pure Harvard architecture wouldn’t allow a computer to load programs for itself to execute. So various compromises are used in practice.\n\n\n\n\nAtmel has since introduced a line of ARM-compatible 32-bit processors, and Arduino has boards using that processor but compatible with the layout of the connectors on the edges.\n\n\nOne thing that has contributed to the popularity of the Arduino with hobbyists is the availability of shields, which are auxiliary circuit boards that plug into the side edge connectors and have the same connectors on their top side. Shields add features to the system. Examples are motor control shields, Bluetooth shields for communicating with cell phones, RFID shields to read those product tags you find inside the packaging of many products, and so on. Both the Arduino company and others sell shields.\n\n\nStack of Arduino shields Image by Wikimedia user Marlon J. Manrique, CC-BY-SA 2.0.\n\n\n\nA completely different hobbyist architecture is the Raspberry Pi. It was designed to be used like a desktop or laptop computer, but with more access to its electronics. It uses an ARM-compatible processor, like most cell phones, but instead of running phone operating system software such as Android, it runs “real” computer operating systems. It ships with Linux, but people have run Windows on it.\n\n\nThe main thing that makes it exciting is that it’s inexpensive: different models range in price from $5 to $35. That price includes just the circuit board, as in the picture, without a keyboard, display, mouse, power adapter, or a case. The main expense in kit computers is the display, so the Pi is designed to plug into your TV. You can buy kits that include a minimal case, a keyboard, and other important add-ons for around $20. You can also buy fancy cases to make it look like any other computer, with a display, for hundreds of dollars.\n\n\nBecause the Pi is intended for educational use, it comes with software, some of which is free for anyone, but some of which generally costs money for non-Pi computers. One important example is Mathematica, which costs over $200 for students (their cheapest price), but is included free on the Pi.\n\n\nLike the Arduino, the Pi supports add-on circuit boards with things like sensors and wireless communication modules.\n\n\nRaspberry Pi board Image by Evan Amos, via Wikimedia, public domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about computer architecture in general.\n\n\nThis needs some heavy edits. For example, perhaps the whole third paragraph, “One recent 64-bit x86…” could be cut. –MF, 11/8/17\n\n\nThe memory hierarchy\n\n\nFor a given cost of circuit hardware, the bigger the memory, the slower it works. For this reason, computers don’t just have one big chunk of memory. There will be a small number of registers inside the processor itself, usually between 8 and 16 of them. The “size” (number of bits) of a data register is equal to the width of the architecture.\n\n\nThe computer’s main memory, these days, is measured in GB (gigabytes, or billions of bytes). A memory of that size can’t be fast enough to keep up with a modern processor. Luckily, computer programs generally have locality of reference, which means that if the program has just made use of a particular memory location, it’s probably going to use a nearby location next. So a complete program may be very big, but over the course of a second or so only a small part of it will be needed. Therefore, modern computers are designed with one or more cache memories—much smaller and therefore faster—between the processor and the main memory. The processor makes sure that the most recently used memory is copied into the cache.\n\n\nOne recent 64-bit x86 processor has a first level (L1) cache of 64KB (thousands of bytes) inside the processor chip, a larger but slower L2 cache of 256 KB, also inside the processor, and an L3 cache of up to 2 MB (megabytes, millions of bytes) outside the processor. Each level of cache has a copy of the most recently used parts of the next level outward: the L1 cache copies part of the L2 cache, which copies part of the L3 cache, which copies part of the main memory. Data in the L1 cache can be accessed by the processor about as fast as its internal registers, and each level outward is a little slower. Hardware in the processor handles all this complexity, so that programmers can write programs as if the processor were directly connected to the main memory.\n\n\nSecond sourcing\n\n\nIntel licenses other chip manufacturers to build processors that use the same architecture as Intel’s processors. Why do they do that? Wouldn’t they make more money if people had to buy from Intel? The reason is that computer manufacturers, such as Dell, Apple, and Lenovo, won’t build their systems around an architecture that is only available from one company. They’re not worried that Intel will go out of business; the worry is that there may be a larger-than-expected demand for a particular processor, and Intel may not be able to fill orders on time. But if that processor is also available from other companies such as AMD and Cyrix, then a delay at Intel won’t turn into a delay at Dell. Those other chip manufacturers may not use the same circuitry as the Intel version, as long as they behave the same at the architecture level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning enough about the Analytical Engine to be able to write even a simple program for it is quite a large undertaking.

    "text": "BH: I would scrap the part about external components, and focus on what’s important and on the AP exam: processor, memory, I/O.\n\n\n\nOn this page, you’ll explore the parts (components) of the computer hardware.\n\n\nFor as long as people have been teaching other people about computers, they always say “A computer consists of the processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices.”\n\n\nIn the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of equipment that contained each of those three components:  \n\n\nThese are pictures of a powerful computer from the 1970s. Each of the big racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator. Today, a much more powerful computer—more speed, more memory—fits inside a cell phone.\n\n\nBecause today’s processors and memory are so small, most of what we see is the input/output (I/O) devices, like keyboard, mouse, screens. Input devices include the keyboard, mouse, and microphone. Output devices include the printer, speaker, and (for laptop or desktop computers) the display screen. On phones and tablets, touchscreens are used for both input and output. Disk drives, optical drives (for CDs and DVDs), and the Internet interface are also used for both.\n\n\n\n\n\nHover the mouse over the numbers to learn about each of the computer components.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On this page, you’ll learn about the physical electronic devices inside the computer: integrated circuits.\n\n\n\nAn integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) is a single physical device that contains millions or billions of basic electrical parts. A processor is an IC, but not all ICs are processors; there are also special-purpose chips inside a computer.\n\n\n\nIn order to have the modern computer age, in which people can carry extremely powerful computers in their pockets (their cell phones), circuits had to become much smaller and cheaper. The invention of the integrated circuit made this possible. Integrated circuits combine (“integrate”) millions or billions of very tiny electrical parts (transistors, resistors, capacitors, and others) packaged into a small plastic box.\n\nThis is the 64-bit Intel Core i7-8700K, © 2017 Intel.\n\n\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize went to Jack Kilby, in 2000, for his 1958 demonstration of a working IC.\n\n\nThe fundamental enabling technology for the computer age was the transistor. In digital circuits, transistors are used as switches. (You’ll learn more about them on an upcoming page.) At first, each transistor was in a separate plastic package. Here’s a picture of a circuit made with discrete (separate) transistors (the black, D-shaped parts) and resistors (the brown, striped, more-or-less cylindrical parts):\n\nPhoto and circuit construction by Simon Inns. License: CC-BY-SA. Downloaded from http://www.waitingforfriday.com.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about what’s in this picture.\n\n\nIn this picture, the transistors are the black, D-shaped parts. The brown, striped, more-or-less cylindrical parts are resistors, a much simpler component that has been around about as long as electricity. The dark lines you can see through the circuit board are wires printed on the board. If your classroom printer had liquid silver ink, it could make circuit boards like this. All the components (transistors and resistors) are on the front of the board. The wires from these components (one at each end of a resistor, three close together on the bottom of a transistor) go through the board, where they are soldered (a kind of hot metallic glue) to the circuit board’s wiring. A few wires are on the front side of the board, because otherwise the circuit couldn’t be made without the printed wires crossing each other.\n\n\nThe IBM 7090, developed in 1959, was built out of discrete transistors—over 50,000 of them. As you can imagine, this machine was large and expensive: about three million dollars, equivalent to over $55 million today. In those days, almost everyone thought that computers would be used only by large corporations or governments.\n\n\n\n\nEarly ICs could include only a few transistors. The circuit in the photo above could just about fit in one IC in the early 1960s, but progress was quick. Today’s computers require billions of transistors. The largest processor chip in 2017, the AMC Epyc, has more than 19 billion transistors!\n\n\n\nSomething as complicated as an IC relies on many levels of abstraction. If an IC has billions of transistors in it, the designer of the IC can’t position each one individually. Instead, they use a special purpose programming language that lets them create small circuit elements, then combine several of those to make a medium-size circuit element, and so on.\n\n\n\nWhat’s inside an IC or a circuit board?\n\n\n\nTantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold are referred to as conflict minerals. They are integral to the technology and other things we rely on every day: from laptops, phones, and tablets to cars, airplanes, lighting, and jewelry. Militias and rebel groups in eastern Congo, funded by the sale of these minerals, have killed over 5 million people since 1998.\n\n\nIn a Central African country rich with natural resources, Congolese miners often endure horrific living conditions, violence and oppression from militias whose conquests are funded by so-called conflict minerals.\n\n\nThe electronics industry is working with miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo to build a verifiable system so consumer devices can be built with conflict-free minerals.\n\nExcerpts from Tech Ethics: Does Conflict Free Matter?(stale link at Intel) and Intel’s Efforts Are Helping Families in the Congo See also Intel Statement on Combating Modern Slavery” Consider the source when reading these.\n\n\n\n\nDo some research on conflict minerals and some of the ways the electronics industry is working with miners to improve these conditions."

    "text": "MF: lightly clean up to make the text more concise\n\n\nDo we have any interest in salvaging the logic gates/XOR project that Selim and I worked on? –MF, 3/25/19\n\n\n\nOn this page, you review three Boolean operators (and, or, and not) and learn how they relate to electronic circuitry.\n\n\nIn a circuit with billions of transistors, or even thousands of transistors, hardware designers can’t think about each individual transistor. Just as programmers use abstraction, hardware architects use abstractions, in which a group of transistors and other circuit elements are considered as a single thing. What kinds of things? There are basically two kinds, one for memory and one for computation.\n\n\nLearn more about memory.\n\n\nMemory is made out of flip-flops. A flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states, on and off. An input signal can tell it to turn on, turn off, or change whatever it’s state is. Once that happens, the flip-flop stays in the new state until it gets another signal. It has an output that reflects its state: on if the flip-flop is on, off if it’s off.\n\n\n\n\nBoolean Operators\n\n\nThe circuits to do computation are more interesting. They compute functions, just like reporters in Snap!. Since computers do a lot of arithmetic, you might think that the basic circuit functions would be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but that’s not the case. Of course there are circuits to do those things, but they’re made out of logic gates: circuits that compute Boolean functions: and, or, and not.\n\n\nThe reason that Boolean functions are considered more fundamental is that their inputs and outputs can be represented with a single wire going into or out from the circuit. That’s not true about arithmetic functions. If you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning 1, and no voltage as meaning 0, then you have to see that an adder will have three possible output values, because 1+1=2, which is neither 0 nor 1. By contrast, if you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning True, and no voltage as meaning False, then the output from a Boolean function of two inputs can still only be True or False, so only one output wire is needed.\n\n\nYou saw some examples in Unit 2 Lab 3: Making Decisions by Using Predicates: AND, OR, and NOT:        \n\n\nSome other ways to think about Boolean operators: It is possible to emulate Boolean operations electronically and these operations are sometimes represented as truth tables (either with true/false or ones/zeros).\n\n\nA circuit emulation and truth tables for and.\n\n\nThis electric circuit shows a simplified way to emulate the Boolean operator and electronically. The two switches are in series; if both of the switches are on, the current flows and the light bulb turns on.\n\n\n\nI wonder about making this simpler by including a pic of a battery in the animation. Students have a lot to manage in this endnote without this extra piece of information that isn’t critical for the learning they are supposed to be doing. –MF, 12/4/17 \n\n\n\nThis symbol in the circuit diagrams represents a battery.  \n\n\n\nThese two tables are identical. One just shows the same pattern with true/false and the other with ones/zeros.\n\n31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602: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:31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602

Gates\n\n\nInside a computer, Boolean operations are implemented in physical circuitry using logic gates. (A single gate implements one of the basic functions and, or, or not.) Logic circuits are often represented with drawings that help engineers see how the information will flow through a circuit. For example, the following diagram of a logic circuit with two gates represents the Boolean expression . Can you see how?\n\n\n\n\n\n Look at the logic circuit drawn above. For what values of A and B will the output be true?\n\n\n\n\nOn the previous page, you learned about tungsten and tin, and here we’re talking about Boolean functions. In what sense is this less abstract? From the point of view of the chip designer, logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of a digital circuit. (The actual physical chip fabrication is at an even lower level of abstraction, in the analog domain.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following expressions will report true?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI only\n\n\nEvaluate each part separately first, and then determine what the outermost block in each expression will report.

What does not((true) or (false)) report?\n\n\n\n\nII only\n\n\nCorrect!\n\n\n\n\nI and II\n\n\nTake another look at expression I.

What does (true) and (false) (on the right) report to the outermost or block?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following logic circuits will report true? (T stands for true, and F stands for false.)\n\n\nThis problem is probably harder than something you’ll see on the exam, so if you can get this one, you are doing great!\n\n31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602: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:31b8e172-b470-440e-83d8-e6b185028602\n\n\n\n\nI only\n\n\nCorrect!\n\n\n\n\nII only\n\n\nTry building both diagrams in Snap! similarly to the images in Question 1 above.\n\n\n\n\nI and II\n\n\nTake another look at diagram II.

That depends on where you draw the line between computers and non-computers.\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: Answer this on the Google Form\n\n\n\nExplore the timeline below, which shows selected events in the history of computing starting 20,000 years ago. Decide what you think makes sense to call the first real computer. Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTally Sticks - First known computing aid.\n\n\n\nTally Sticks (c. 18,000 BCE)\n\n\n20,000 years ago people cut patterns of notches into animal bones. Some experts believe that tally sticks were used to perform arithmetic computations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus - Ancient calculator, still in use.\n\n\n\nThe Abacus (c. 2,000 BCE)\n\n\nThe abacus is a computing device invented about 4,000 years ago. People who are well-trained to use it can perform calculations remarkably quickly, including square roots and cube roots on multi-digit numbers. In some countries, the abacus is still widely used today.\n\n\nImage by Wikimedia user HB, Public Domain.\n\n  The computation algorithms are executed by the user, not the device.\n\n\n\n\nOrrery - Mechanical device that computes planets’ orbits.\n\n\n\nThe Orrery (c. 100 BCE)\n\n\nSince antiquity, many special-purpose computing devices have been invented. For example this orrery displayed the positions of the planets in the Solar System. The first known device of this kind dated from about 2100 years ago. People at that time generally believed that the sun and other planets all revolved around the Earth, making the positions very complicated to work out, so the mechanism was much harder to design and build than it would be today.\n\nNo machine-readable image author provided.

See more on the digital architecture page.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Engine - Babbage: First stored-program computer.\n\n\n\nThe Analytical Engine (c. 1833)\n\n\nThe Difference Engine could compute various functions by manually setting the starting position of its gears, but it had only one algorithm, built into the hardware design. In 1833, Babbage began a more ambitious project, the Analytical Engine. It was based on the general idea of the Difference Engine, but with a crucial difference: It could carry out instructions in a primitive programming language, prepared on punched cards. See more on the digital architecture page.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Programmer - Ada Lovelace: First to understand the potential of programs for non-numeric data.\n\n\n\nThe First Programmer (c. 1842)\n\n\nBabbage’s design was very versatile, but his interest was still mainly in printing tables of numbers. It was his collaborator Ada, Countess Lovelace, who first recognized that the numbers in Babbage’s computer could be used not only as quantities but also as representing musical notes, text characters, and so on. See more on the digital architecture page.\n\n\n\nImage by Alfred Edward Chalon, Science & Society Picture Library, Public Domain, via Wikimedia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Turing wins World War II - Alan Turing leads a team that breaks the Enigma code using a very early electronic programmable computer.\n\n\n\nAlan Turing Wins World War II (1940s)\n\n\nWell, we’re exaggerating. Many people contributed to the Nazi defeat. But they weren’t all soldiers; some were mathematicians. Turing, who went on to develop the beginning ideas of computer science and to prove the Halting Theorem, which you saw in Unit 5, Lab 4: An Undecidable Problem, was the leader of a British team of mathematicians who made a breakthrough in decrypting messages encrypted with the German Enigma machine.\n\n\nCryptanalysis of the Enigma enabled western Allies in World War II to read substantial amounts of secret Morse-coded radio communications of the Axis powers. The western Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower considered the military intelligence from this and other decrypted Axis radio and teleprinter transmissions “decisive” to the Allied victory…\n\n\nAlan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking and designed the device. Engineer Harold “Doc” Keen turned Turing’s ideas into a working machine. (adapted from Cryptanalysis of the Enigma, Wikipedia CC-BY-SA)\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Mouse, Window System, etc. - Douglas Engelbart: An amazing number of firsts, including first hypertext, first collaborative editing, first video calling, much more.\n\n\n\n“The mother of all demos” (1960s)\n\n\nThe first public demonstration in 1968 of a mouse, colleagues separated by miles working on the same screen, and many other technologies we now take for granted was so astonishing to the audience that it became known as “the mother of all demos.” (Just search that name on Wikipedia or YouTube.)\n\n\nThe inventor of this system, Douglas Engelbart, had a lifelong interest in using technology to augment human intelligence, in particular to support collaboration among people physically distant. He studied people doing intellectual work and noted that when they’re not using a computer they don’t sit rigidly in front of their desks; they wheel their chairs around the room as they grab books or just think. So he designed an office chair attachment of a lapboard containing a keyboard and a mouse—the first mouse. He also invented a way for people to collaborate on the same page at the same time, seeing each others’ mouse cursors. Documents created in the system had hyperlinks to other documents, long before the Web was invented and used this idea. There were lots of smaller firsts, too, such as a picture-in-picture display of the other person’s face camera, long before Skype. People remember Engelbart mostly because of the mouse, but he pioneered many features of the modern graphical user interface (GUI).\n\n\n\n\n\nSketchpad - Ivan Sutherland: First object-oriented programming system, early interactive display graphics.\n\n\n\nSketchpad (1963)\n\n\nIvan Sutherland’s 1963 Ph.D. thesis project, a program to help in drawing blueprints from points, line segments and arcs of circles, pioneered both object oriented programming and the ability to draw on a screen (using a light pen; the mouse hadn’t been invented yet). It was one of the first programs with an interactive graphical user interface, so people who weren’t computer programmers could use it easily.\n\n\nSearch for “Sketchpad” on YouTube to see a demonstration of this software.\n\n\n\n\n\nARPANET - The first version of what became the Internet.\n\n\n\nARPANET (1969)\n\n\nThe Advanced Research Projects Agency\n(ARPA) of the US Defense Department was and is still the main funder of computer science research in the United States. In the late 1960s through the early 1980s they supported the development of a network connecting mainly universities with ARPA-funded projects, along with a few military bases. The initial network in 1969 consisted of four computers, three in California and one in Utah. At its peak, around 1981, there were about 200 computers on the net. With such a small number of computers, each of them knew the name and “host number” of all the others. Special gateway computers called IMPs (Interface Message Processors) were used to connect the host computers to the network, like a router today.\n\n\nOnly organizations with ARPA research grants could be on the net. This meant almost all the network sites were universities, along with a small number of technology companies doing work for ARPA. Everyone knew everyone, and so the network was built around trust. People were encouraged to use other sites’ resources; there was a yearly published directory of all the network computers, including, for most of them, information on how to log in as a guest user. It was a much friendlier spirit than today’s Internet, with millions of computers and millions of users who don’t know or trust each other. But the friendly spirit was possible only because access to the ARPANET was strongly restricted.\n\n\nThe architects of the ARPANET knew that a system requiring every computer to know the address of every other computer wasn’t going to work for a network accessible to everyone. Their plan was to build a network of networks—the Internet. The TCP/IP protocol stack was designed and tested on the ARPANET.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet - First network of networks, based on TCP/IP.\n\n\n\nInternet (1986)\n\n\nGradually the ARPANET was divided into pieces. The first big pieces were MILNET for military bases and NSFnet, established in 1986 by the National Science Foundation, for research sites. This split was the beginning of the Internet. Smaller regional networks were created. Communication companies such as AT&T created commercial networks that anyone could join. Network access spread worldwide through satellite radio and through undersea cables. In 1995 the NSFnet was abolished, and everyone connected to the net through commercial Internet Service Providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Wide Web - Tim Berners-Lee: First widely available hypertext (clickable links) system.\n\n\n\nWorld Wide Web (1989-90)\n\n\nIn the early days of the net, the main application-level protocols were Telnet, which allowed a user to log in remotely to another computer, and FTP (File Transfer Protocol), for copying files from one computer to another. FTP is great if you already know what you’re looking for, and exactly where it is in the other computer’s file system.\n\n\nSeveral people had the idea of a system that would allow users to embed links to files into a conversation, so you could say “I think this document might help you.” In 1945, Vannevar Bush described a hypothetical device with the ability to embed links in files. In 1963, Ted Nelson made up the word “hypertext” as the name for this feature, but the first actual implementation was Douglas Engelbart’s system NLS, developed starting in 1963 and demonstrated in 1968.\n\n\nIn 1989, physicist Tim Berners-Lee implemented a hypertext system and named it the World Wide Web. At first it was used only by physicists, to share data and ideas. But by then the Internet was running, so his timing was right, and the name was much more appealing than the technical-sounding “hypertext” (although, as you saw in Unit 4, Lab 3: A Hierarchy of Open Protocols, behind the scenes, the protocol that makes the Web work is called the “HyperText Transfer Protocol” or HTTP). The growth of the Web was very rapid, from about 500 servers in 1993 to over 10,000 in 1994. Today, many people talk as if “the Internet” and “the Web” were the same thing, but you’ve learned that they are not in Unit 4, Lab 1: What Is the Internet?.\n\n\nBerners-Lee’s vision was of a Web in which everyone would be both a creator and a consumer of information. But the Web quickly became a largely one-way communication, with a few commercial websites getting most of the traffic. Today, most Web traffic goes to Google, Facebook, CNN, Amazon, and a few others. But some degree of democracy came back to the Web with the invention of the blog (short for “web log”) in which ordinary people can post their opinions and hope that other people will notice them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Smartphones - First portable devices combining cell phone with pocket computer.\n\n\n\nSmartphones (1990s)\n\n\nThe first device that could be thought of as a smartphone was demonstrated in 1992 and available for sale in 1994. But through the 1990s, people who wanted portable digital devices could get a cell phone without apps, and a “personal digital assistant” (PDA) that did run apps but couldn’t make phone calls. Around 1999, a few companies developed devices with the phone and the PDA in one housing, sharing the screen but essentially two separate computers in one box. The Kyocera 6035, in the photo, was a telephone with the flap closed, but was a Palm Pilot PDA with the flap open.\n\n\nKyocera 6035  image by KeithTyler, Public Domain\n\n\nThere is something weird about this image file, and I can’t figure it out. Moving on. –MF, 12/7/17\n\n\n\nIt was in the late 2000s that the two functions of a smartphone were combined in a single processor, with the telephone dialer as just one application-level program.\n\n\n\n\n\nChess program beats world champion - Deep Fritz program beats Vladimir Kramnik.\n\n\n\nChess program beats world champion (2006)\n\n\nProgrammers have been trying to design and build chess programs since at least 1941 (Konrad Zuse). Over the following decade, several of the leading computer science researchers (including Alan Turing, in 1951) published ideas for chess algorithms, but the first actual running programs came in 1957. In 1978, a chess program won a game against a human chess master, David Levy, but Levy won the six-game match 4½–1½. (The half points mean that one game was a tie.)\n\n\nThere are only finitely many possible chess positions, so in principle a program could work through all possible games and produce a complete dictionary of the best possible move for each player from each position. But there are about 1043 board positions, and in 1950, Claude Shannon estimated that there are about 10120 possible games, far beyond the capacity of even the latest, fastest computers. Chess programs, just like human players, can only work out all possible outcomes of the next few moves, and must then make informed guesses about which possible outcome is the best.\n\n\nA turning point in computer chess came in 1981, when the program Cray Blitz was the first to win a tournament, beat a human chess master, and earn a chess master rating for itself. The following year, the program Belle became the second computer program with a chess master rating. In 1988 two chess programs, HiTech and Deep Thought, beat human chess grandmasters.\n\n\nIn 1997, Deep Blue, an IBM-built special-purpose computer just to play chess, with 30 processors plus 480 special-purpose ICs to evaluate positions, beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match, 3½–2½. Its special hardware allowed Deep Blue to evaluate 200 million board positions per second.\n\n\nIn 2006, world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik was defeated 4-2 in a six-game match by Deep Fritz, a chess program running on an ordinary computer. Although the score looks overwhelming, one of the games Deep Fritz won was almost a win for Kramnik, who failed to see a winning move for himself and instead set up the computer for a one-move checkmate. Without this blunder, the match would have been tied 3–3.\n\n\nChess programs continue to improve. In 2009, the program Pocket Fritz 4, running on a cell phone, won a tournament and reached grandmaster rating. The program, in contrast to Deep Blue, could evaluate only 20,000 positions per second, so this win shows an improvement in strategy, not just an improvement in brute force computer speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri - Apple’s personal assistant for the iPhone.\n\n\n\nSiri (2011)\n\n\nSiri is Apple’s personal assistant software. It was first released as a third-party app in the App Store in 2010; Apple then bought the company that made it, and included Siri as part of iOS in 2011.\n\n\nSiri was not the first program to understand speech. Dragon Dictate, a speech-to-text program was released in 1990. Research laboratory efforts started much earlier than that; in 1952, a program developed at Bell Labs was able to understand spoken digits. As time went on, the number of words understood by the programs increased. In 2002, Microsoft introduced a version of its Office programs (including Word) that would take spoken dictation.\n\n\nIn 2006, the National Security Administration (NSA) started using software to recognize keywords in the telephone calls it spies on.\n\n\nThe first cell phone app using speech recognition was Google’s Voice Search in 2008, but it just entered the words it heard in a search bar without trying to understand them. What was new in Siri wasn’t speech recognition, but its ability to understand the sentences spoken by its users as commands to do something: “Call Fred,” “Make an appointment with Sarah for 3pm tomorrow,” and so on.\n\n\nReviews of Siri’s performance in 2011 weren’t all good. It had trouble understanding Southern US or Scottish accents. It had a lot of trouble with grammatically ambiguous sentences. Its knowledge of local landmarks was spotty. Nevertheless, it prompted a new surge of buyers of Apple telephones.\n\n\nMore recently, Microsoft (Cortana), Amazon (Alexa), and Google (Assistant) have introduced competing speech-based personal assistant programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPokémon Go - First widely used augmented reality game.\n\n\n\nPokémon Go (2016)\n\n\nAugmented reality is a technique in which the user sees the real world, but with additional pictures or text superimposed on it. Although it had been used earlier, the first major public exposure to augmented reality was in the game Pokémon Go. Players walk around while looking at their phone screens, which show what the camera is seeing, but with the occasional addition of a cartoon character for the player to catch. Every player looking at the same place sees the same character, because the game uses the phone’s GPS to locate the player.\n\n\nThe programming of the game was impressive, but even more impressive was the effort the developers put into placing the cartoon characters at locations around the world that are accessible, open to the public, and not offensive. (Niantic, the company that developed the game, had to remove some locations from their list because of complaints, including cemeteries and Holocaust museums.)\n\n\nThe game was downloaded over 500 million times in 2016, and, unusually for a video game, was enthusiastically supported by many players’ parents, because the game gets players out of the house, and getting exercise from walking around. Also, because players congregate at the locations of Pokémon, the game encouraged real-life friendships among players. On the other hand, there were safety concerns, partly because players would cross streets staring into their phones instead of watching for traffic, and partly because certain Pokémon were placed in front of fire stations, or in locations that encouraged players to cross railroad tracks.\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM Quantum Experience - A 16-qubit quantum computer available for free use on the Internet.\n\n\n\nIBM Quantum Experience (QX) (2017)\n\n\nIBM first put a five-qubit (quantum bit) quantum computer on the Internet in 2016 (see Quantum Computing - IBM Q - US), but the following year they added a much more powerful 16-qubit computer. (The qubit is the equivalent for quantum computers of a bit in ordinary computers.) Anyone can use it, free of charge, although there is always a waiting list for appointments.\n\n\nThe usual oversimplified description of quantum computing is that a qubit (pronounced “Q bit”) is “both zero and one at the same time.” It’s closer to say that a qubit is either zero or one, but we don’t know which until it is examined at the end of a computation, at which point it becomes an ordinary bit with a fixed value. This means that a quantum computer with 16 qubits isn’t quite as powerful as 216\nseparate computers trying every possible combination of bit values in parallel. We know that certain exponential-time algorithms can be solved in polynomial time by quantum computers, and we know that certain others can’t, but there is still a big middle ground of exponential-time algorithms for which we don’t know how fast quantum computers can be.\n\n\nThe IBM QX has been used for a wide variety of quantum computations, ranging from academic research to a multiplayer Quantum Battleship game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind this timeline is outdated…  But look at the timeline. The year markers at the bottom are equally spaced, but the number of years between them is not the same. The number of years does change in a regular way from marker to marker: right to left it goes up by a multiple of ten. We call such a scale logarithmic.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Answer this on the Google Form\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\n\nDoes a device have to be programmable to be a computer?\n\n\nDoes it have to operate by itself?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are two key ideas:\n\n\nSoftware, in the form of a program stored in the computer’s memory, is, itself, a kind of abstraction. It is what makes a computer usable for more than one purpose.\n\n\nWe didn’t get usable computers until there was an underlying technology (the transistor) small enough, inexpensive enough, and fast enough to support the program abstraction."

    "text": "On this page, you’ll learn that computer processor speed and memory size have approximately doubled every year or two, for over 50 years.\nIn 1965, Gordon Moore, one of the pioneers of integrated circuits, predicted that the number of transistors that could be fit on one chip would double every year. In 1975, he revised his estimate to doubling every two years. This prediction is known as Moore’s Law.\nIt turns out that other important measurements have also shown roughly the same doubling behavior, such as processor speed and the amount of memory that fits in a computer. Doubling hardware speed improves the size of problems that you can efficiently handle.\nThe importance of Moore’s Law isn’t just that computers get bigger and faster over time; it’s that engineers can predict how much bigger and faster, which helps them plan the software and hardware development projects to start today, for use five years from now."

    "text": "Limitations to Moore’s Law\n\n\nFor transistor counts to keep growing, the size of a transistor must keep getting smaller. But chip density and processor speed have run up against an important limit: denser chips and faster signal processing both generate increased heat. Current technology is right at the edge of generating enough heat to melt the chips, destroying the computer. This is why processor chips are surrounded by metal heat sinks (one shown right), which conduct heat away from the chip and into the air.\n\n\n\n\nHeat sinks aren’t solid blocks of metal; they have spikes and zigzags. Figure out or look up why.\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the heat problem, chip manufacturers have, at least temporarily, given up on making processors faster. Instead, they are putting more than one processor on a chip. If a computation can carry out the same algorithm on different parts of the data at the same time (in parallel—sort of like sprite clones all running the same script at the same time), then these multicore chips can have an effective speed much greater than the speed of a single processor. A computer you buy today is likely to have two or four processors on one chip. But using multicore efficiently requires that the software be written with multicore in mind.\n\n\nLearn about limitations to Moore’s Law.\n\n\nSome time in the next decade, the size of a transistor will approach the size of an atom, but at the atomic scale, transistors won’t work for various reasons. There is a more fundamental limit to the density of transistors on a chip than just heat issues. And similarly, there are fundamental limitations that affect the speed of a processor, such as the speed of electrons through a wire.\n\n\nMoore’s Law optimists argue that technologies other than transistors will become usable before manufacturers hit a fundamental limit. One such approach would involve using an individual electron to represent one bit. Electrons are smaller than atoms, so this technology would allow further dramatic increases in density. Another approach would use light beams rather than electric current to hold bits. But these developments are still far away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Gordon Moore observed in 1965, data show that computer processing speeds roughly double every two years. Technology companies use this observation, now known as “Moore’s Law,’ in their planning. From the following, identify which one best describes how technology companies can use Moore’s Law in planning.\n\n\n\nThey can expect to double their profits every two years.\n\n\nNo such thing is possible to predict using Moore’s Law.\n\n\n\n\nThey can anticipate the precise dates when the latest computing advancements will be available and therefore accurately plan their products in advance.\n\n\nNo such thing is possible to predict using Moore’s Law.\n\n\n\n\nThey can base their R&D (Research and Development) targets on expected future processing speeds.\n\n\nCorrect.\n\n\n\n\nThey can expect their costs to double with each increase in processor speed.\n\n\nNo such thing is possible to predict using Moore’s Law."

    "text": "In this project, you’ll create a game that teaches the history of computers, based off what you learned in this unit and self-research.\n\nRecall that from Unit 6, we touched on the history of computers in Lab 2. Now it’s time for you to create a game that can teach someone about the history of computers.\n\n\nBEFORE YOU DO YOUR ACTUAL CODING, Create a write-up detailing your ideas for how to code the project for each event/interaction and outline for the game.\n\nRequirements:\n\nReference specific blocks and solutions for your code (e.g. Will you use a list? What blocks will you create and what will they do? Which built-in blocks will you think can help you create a specific portion of the project?)\nWritten in a logical order.\nAt least 1000 words.\n\nDue on Friday, 5/19/2023.\nA template for this write-up is in your Google Classroom assignment.\n\nCreate a game (the design is up to you!) where the user is either asked computer history trivia questions, or interesting facts about computer history are presented as the game is played. The game cannot be just a quiz game like we did in U2L2. There must be some sort of sprite movement and either dexterity, accuracy, and/or problem-solving challenge apart from answering questions.\n\nThe requirements for this game will be to:\n\nHave creative and artistic value by having relevant sprite costumes involved in the project.\nFrom the various events listed on Unit 6, Lab 2, Page 1, use at least 5 of the events.\nIn addition, find and research two other events that are not listed on Unit 6, Lab 2, Page 1 to add to your project. Do your own research on what you think was a “ground-breaking” or important development.\n\nAt least one of these must be a development from the last 3 years.\n\n\nDue halfway through the finals period (Wednesday 5/31 for Period 4 and Thursday 6/1 for Periods 5 and 6. The second half of the finals period will be to showcase your projects and/or party time.\n\n\n\nThis final project is worth 50 points on your project/assessment grade."
